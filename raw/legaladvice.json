She let some people rent an apartment in her name and with her credit. Long story short, they didn't pay the rent which accumulated for a while until reaching about 8000 dollars. They then moved somewhere else and left her with the debt although she never lived in the apartment. So, now the apartment is sending her to collections. What can she do about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

By our understanding she had no official will for herself, and was pending a divorce with my father.  My mother and father were working with a mediator regarding how to file the divorce and getting the details smoothed out before filing.  \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> The mediator loved my mother so much that she is in contact with some of her best friends and is still working to have something worked out.  The divorce was nearly finished, meaning all details were finalized but it was not officially submitted.  She has been talking to my mothers best friends saying that she is going to try and have something created so that my mothers assets are transferred to myself and my sister, and not my father as that is what her wishes would have been.  What can I do here to help or ensure this is taken care of?  My mother had quite a lot of money from the split in the bank, and a house as well which was in her name.  My father is now back in the US and is trying to manage all of these details regarding her money and such, but I know my mom would not want a single dime of it to go to him and would want all of it for her kids.  I am not trying to have this be a kids versus dad argument, but all I want is for my moms wishes to be fulfilled. \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> Another very important part is that I need to get my sister on insurance fast.  I currently work for a very large company, and just called their benefits line to see if I could get my sister/dad added to my insurance.  The lady had told me that the only way for this to happen is if my sister was officially and legally a dependent of mine per court order.  That seems a bit odd and I have heard otherwise.  Any advice here is appreciated, much love.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Leaving a vehicle running and \"unattended\" isn't negligent. Handing the keys to a cracked person and telling them to have fun would.\n\nTheir insurance is going to deny any liability because of the criminal act.\n\nYou need to follow through with the prosecutor's office. There's often victim funds and sometimes these offenders have friends/family with deep pockets that will pay up.",

It allows us to cool or heat the back cab while we're bringing a pt out, which can sometimes take awhile if they're weak, unconscious, etc. and helps warm or cool them in environmental exposures like hyper or hypothermia. \n\nMOST of our rigs have a anti-theft device where we can remove the key and leave the truck running. If you try to drive away without the keys the ambulance shuts off as soon as you press the brake to shift.

That's generally iffy. If he does, wouldn't he also prefer to spray away from himself or know to spray his wrists to determine the smell? If not, if he prefers cologne, doesn't he also not generally spray himself in the face with it?\n\nThis isn't legal advice, this is more you don't actually have the real story here that you *need* before actually seeking legal advice.\n\nBecause if I had to guess, your son brought in pepper spray, decided to show it off and maced himself, and then came up with this story. \n\nAnd that's bringing a weapon into school and that's how you get expelled, and you need real legal advice to deal with that, because that is very serious.\n\nAlso, if that's what happened, it's also hilarious and he's gonna want to change schools if anyone saw him do that to himself, because he ain't ever living that shit down.",

He is a very shy, introverted 13 year old white boy in an inner city school. Last year he was being bullied so bad we had to remove him from the school and have him home schooled. Now, not 2 months into the year, here we are with more problems again. \n> \n>   \n> \n> So apparently, last Monday (the 5th), a group of three girls he hangs out with had brought a pink pepper spray device to school with them. During class, the girl who brought it is trying to press the button, nothing happens, so she passes it to the next girl, who cant get it to work, and then they hand it to my son and ask him to try. He, not knowing what pepper spray is and thinking it was \"perfume\" pushed the button, setting it off. He was the only one hit with any of it, but none-the-less, the classroom was quarantined and he has been put in the alternative (Learn-to-be-a-criminal Middle School) school until they decide at his hearing this coming Monday whether or not he is to be charged with assault with a weapon and be expelled for 180 days. \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> I am trying to prepare for the bout that will be his hearing Monday, but I don't even understand how it has gotten to this point when he wasn't even the one who brought it to school, etc. So far none of the other girls have received any disciplinary action. \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> Please help this worried father... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Not all small claims courts do; most don't, in fact. Courts do not hear matters of dog/pet custody except one state. They are considered property no different than a camera or painting, and the civil resource for stolen property is to sue for how much they are worth, not the return of it. \n\nThe second problem is no agreement exists between the GF and OP. His dad agreed to watch the dog, his duty of care was breached as it was to watch the dog until OP returned. The GF holds the property and now knows it may be stolen, but that matters far less. Courts do not generally allow indirect routes of remedy. OPs dad agreed to look after his dog and gave it to his girlfriend. The dad needs to repay OP for the value of getting a new dog with the same pedigree, training, and things like being neutered, up to date on shots and so on. Essentially, he is owed what it would cost to get a dog exactly like he has now. ",

People who have this will search around for clues in their environment to make sense of that sudden shift.

She also wasn\u2019t sleeping deeply enough, not getting into a state of REM and hadn\u2019t been for weeks. These were two huge factors in amplifying her symptoms. \n\nTake her to the ER and they will hopefully give her something that helps her sleep and stabilize. If needed they may take her to another facility for a few days to stabilize her brain chemistry and make sure she gets the initial help she\u2019s needs. \n\nGood luck OP, I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this. \n",

Tricking her may be necessary but don't be outlandish. Maybe call it a regular check up. Being harsh or stern will probably make her recoil. \n\nNow if for whatever reason she becomes completely resistant to the idea or dangerous you can try civil commitment. State laws vary but the just is she will be committed for a couple days and evaluated by a doctor who will determine if she is a danger to herself or others. In some states this includes not being able to provide for one's basic needs. This is an extreme measure which should be used as a last resort. It will severely damage your mother's trust in you but may be necessary. \n\nI want to reiterate that taking her voluntarily with a little trickery is the best choice. Being forceful or \"telling her how it is\" will have to opposite effect. Suggest she should get a checkup and you'd be willing to schedule it and take her. Don't reinforce delusions but if she finds some weird rationale for seeing a doctor, go with it.",

She\u2019s also pretty sure she\u2019s demon possessed. How do I deal with this?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> About two months ago, my Mother became homeless. She\u2019s been ill and she\u2019s also been an alcoholic for the last twenty years. She was hospitalized in another state, stayed in a nursing rehab facility for about month, and when she was released she had lost her apartment and everything she owned.\n> \n> My sister and I spent every dime we had to get her to the state where I currently reside and into an apartment of her own. I now have full legal and medical power of attorney.\n> \n> Yesterday, Mom called me and she sounded upset so I asked her what was wrong. She told me that she has a lot of guilt and she\u2019s worried she\u2019s going to go to Hell. I asked her why. \n> \n> Well, she was a nurse for 35 years (she\u2019s 65 now) and she tells me that she, more than just a few times, put her patients out of their misery. She went on in great detail, when it started, how she felt, etc. She says she feels like a murderer. Well, if it\u2019s the truth I guess she is. \n> \n> So, at this point I\u2019m completely freaked out. \n> \n> She then goes on to tell me that she\u2019s been seeing a demon at the end of her bed and that it crawls up the side of her bed. She says she tries to pray but only gibberish comes out of her mouth. \n> \n> There\u2019s obviously no demon. At this point, I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s something fucky going on in her head. I\u2019m also not 100% certain that she\u2019s not lying about killing her patients. She\u2019s always been a bit of a special case.\n> \n> I called my sister afterwards to tell her about our conversation. As soon as she answers, before I can tell her about the shit our Mother has just said, she asks me to \u201cplease, for the love of God, go to Mom\u2019s house and sign her out of the Netflix account.\u201d\n> \n> See, she\u2019s signed in to my sister\u2019s Netflix, and even though we made her her own profile, she\u2019s managed to sign herself into my brother-in-law\u2019s profile instead and has screwed up his lists. Naturally, I ask her what Mom has been watching.\n> \n> Nurse Jackie and American Horror Story.\n> \n> My Mother has been binge-watching TV shows and is losing her mind. She\u2019s now deluded herself into believing that she\u2019s a demon possessed Nurse Jackie.\n> \n> So, I guess I need to have her evaluated. But, how do I go about doing this? Do I take her to the ER and not tell her I\u2019m taking her for a psych evaluation?\n> \n> And, what if she\u2019s NOT making up the part where she actually killed some of her patients? \n> \n> She said some really weird shit. She has, in the past, put some of our pets \u201cto sleep\u201d herself using her own medications because they were old, or, sick. And, my sister once caught her trying to serve my father coffee with hemlock in it right before they got divorced.\n> \n> What is my course of action?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

If you think she's an immediate threat to herself or other people, then you should involve the police.  Otherwise, I'd get her to a qualified and licensed therapist or psychologist.\n\n>And, what if she\u2019s NOT making up the part where she actually killed some of her patients?\n\nMental health clinicians have a duty to keep confidential what is said to them.  They can recommend treatment plans around what they know, such as a recommendation to put her into a long-term care facility.  Additionally, the therapist can share some relevant information if it is germane to treatment, such as diagnosis so they can properly bill insurance.  However, their job is to care for her mental health, and not rat her out for what she may or may not have done.  It's their job to help her with whatever is distressing her.\n\nThere are exceptions to confidentiality, of course.  Clinicians also have a duty to warn if a patient makes a credible threat to hurt somebody else, or if they disclose something ongoing (eg \"I put patients out of their misery on a regular basis\"), or anything that falls under \"mandated reporting\" (eg child abuse).\n\n[https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/confidentiality.aspx](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/confidentiality.aspx)",

When I was hourly, the company I was with, for instance, paid me every Friday for the prior Sunday-Saturday, which gave them time to do payroll after everyone's hours were in, but meant my pay still happened on an expected date, so I could do things like pay rent.

My SO works for a large company with a well-known \u201ctreats their employees like shit\u201d rep. and for the second time in two months his paycheck is late (it isn\u2019t just him, it\u2019s everyone in at least his building, maybe the others.) \n> \n> Last time it was late by one day, this time it\u2019s been two days and because of the weekend will likely be at least two more before we see that money. We sort of anticipated this and have budgeted enough to cover our basic necessities until it gets sorted, but we won\u2019t have that option next time.\n> \n> His next payday is supposed to be the first, the same day we\u2019re supposed to move, and the same day our 30 day hold on the apartment is up. If they don\u2019t pay us on time, we\u2019ll lose the apartment and actually be homeless instead of near-homeless. We have fought long and hard to become stable, mentally, physically, and financially. We haven\u2019t been responsible in the past, but we\u2019ve both made huge lifestyle changes and gotten a lot of professional help. I\u2019m enraged that even when we finally turn things around and work our butts off that we may lose everything anyway simply because my SOs company doesn\u2019t think paying their employees on time is important. \n> \n> I don\u2019t necessarily want to lawyer up and go all out or anything, but I feel totally powerless in the face of this big company and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s *any* recourse here. Anything at all I can do to try and ensure we get our next check on time? A letter, a lawyer, anything? Or are we at their mercy? We have a daughter and I just want to get her into a real home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

What are my options?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> The other party's insurance is being belligerent, ghosting me, and arbitrarily decided they will pay for just 10% of damages when they are responsible for 100%. This is after they kept denying any fault, oversimplifying the case, and trying to get me to accept all fault. They finally \"compromised\" with admitting 10-20% fault.   \n> \n> \n> After arguing with the agent responsible, she kept threateningly telling me that she is the one with the power to decide whether i get 10-20%. So I guess since she doesn't like me I get 10% now? Or another possible angle is, I get 20% and threatening with 10% was a tactic to make me feel grateful for getting 20% so I don't pursue this further\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> How can I hold this agent accountable and do I have options in small claims court? Would there be any use in pursuing the person who hit me with legal action directly (they lied about the accident and I believe my pictures make it obvious) or is my best bet with pursuing their insurance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Nothing I can do to prevent that?\n\nI agree with the positives, I do. I welcome the relief of even a separation.  But I can't work 30 more years to make up for what she takes.  I just can't.  \n\nThe only reason I stayed with her is that I protect my kids from her insanity.  They are good, well-rounded kids because I refused to let her beat them, refused to let her guilt them into things, refused to let her spread ignorance into their impressionable minds, and refused to let her just raise illogical, dumb kids.  My kids are awesome, and it's because of me.  They're 12 and 13 now - they're at the age where their friends will start becoming their biggest influencers.  But I still must be there to protect them from her.  She is an awful person.  My kids see her lying and instead of me calling her out on it, they do.  It's reassuring, but she still trys to convince them she's telling the truth.  She still pressures my kids into doing things they don't want to by guilting them or making them feel bad.   How can I protect them if I'm not in their lives.\n\nHow can I ensure their future when she takes everything? \n\nIf we were to go to mediation, and one of the items I want to settle on is less than 50%, what would be a reasonable offer?  When she's not made she says that she's not out to take my stuff.  When she's mad she says she's fighting for 50%",

Property you accumulated before marriage is your separate property. \n\nThe standard explanation for a property divided in a state with equitable division of property in a  divorce (like IN) is that the division must be fair but not necessarily equal. The reality is that the default is basically equal. \n\nIf you reached a negotiated agreement for property division, the court would adopt that. But when a court does the division after a contested trial the usual result is pretty close to equal, and frequently exactly equal (remember this is marital property only that is being divided). \n\nBased on your post your attorney may have some arguments to make that she should get less than half. But you are basically starting at a presumption of half and having to convince the judge otherwise. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that things that you think would be relevant in determining the division of property wont be legally relevant. Or maybe it will be relevant that you paid her debt off, etc. That may help you get out for less than 1/2. \n\nAn attorney who does this for a living in your jurisdiction will be familiar with your potential judges and will be able to give you some guesses how it might go. When your wife talks to an attorney she will get some guesses too. Then when you are each familiar with the probable range of outcomes you can mediate/negotiate and try to settle this without going to trial  (which saves a bunch of money in legal fees). Settlement short of trial whether by agreed arbitration, mediation or whatever resolves far more cases that go to trial in my state and county. \n\nThere is still a good chance you can negotiate this. But you have to have a lawyer to help you figure out likely best vs worse vs most likely outcomes could be to be able to figure out a fair offer. If you settle if will most likely be for more than you wanted but less than she hoped for (which is typical for divorce between parties with large disparity in earning ability). \n\nThis will absolutely be expensive though. In my locale good family law lawyers charge $300 to $400 per hour and it\u2019s higher in the largest city in my state. Lawyers bill in tenths if an hour. That means every time you talk to your attorney on the phone or email them and  they email you back it will cost an absolute minimum of one tenth of an hour. \n\nExpect to pay a retainer of (wild ass guess) $5000 to $10000, which the lawyer will bill against and you will be responsible to replenish when it gets below a certain amount. \n\n\n",

Be the stable person they need to be, don't be bitter, and as much as it hurts you always take the high road.\n\nAs others have said, go into this assuming 50/50 on assets and be pleasantly surprised if you do better than this. There are good historical reasons for the system being set up this way. It's better to get your mind around that now so that you're not bitter down the road.\n\nDon't make concessions in the hopes that it'll make things easier. It won't; your wife has shown that she's quite happy to take advantage. On the flip side, don't be an a\\*\\*hole (for the sake of your sanity and for the kids).

So unless she decides of *her own volition* to reach an agreement with you in which she doesn't take *what she is entitled to*, that is the default outcome. \n\nFROM THERE, you have other expenses looming. Depending on your state, unless the divorce is a result of her cheating on you (or meets some other conditions you'll want to look up), she can file for alimony payments -- especially with 14 years of marriage in the bank. \n\nAdditionally, your state's Child Support rules will take effect. In my state, it's a straight up mathematical calculation based on the number of children, each parent's gross income, how much each parent spends on day care and healthcare for the children, and the percentage of time the kids spend with each parent... and that's pretty much it. Whatever the formula spits out, that's what you / she owes. With me, I make a little over twice what my ex makes and we split the kids 50-50, but we're both decently high earners... so I pay her about 15% of my net income each month.\n\nAs far as your next move goes, the $20K loan is a no-no. Your next move is to get a good divorce lawyer, don't make any big money moves, be as cordial as possible with her, do not speak badly of her to the kids, and do whatever the hell else your lawyer tells you to do.\n\nGood luck.",

I was hoping you someone can help. My dad has serious memory and physical impairments, and we have him in an assisted living facility. He has issues with using the restroom on his own and tends to pee the bed, and he wears adult diapers throughout the day. My sister was taking him to a doctors appointment and he defecated on himself while at his facility. To get help cleaning him up, she called a nurse. They refused to help him, even though it is listed as their job and is promised by the facility. They were degrading him in front of my sister while he was right there in the bathroom hearing everything. They constantly yell at him and make him clean himself up, even though he don't have use of one of his arms. His roommate told us that this happens often. What are our rights and should we seek legal help? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

We are on 10th grade, I'm 15 but he is 18, which is why I am asking for an advice. I want to report him to the authorities, but I am scared, they can find out it was me, since I complained about that when he sent the video, and they can do something to me, because, if I'm not wrong, he can go to prison. Please help me, I do not know what to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

While the eBay case was opened, I wrote up a \"statement of facts\" (legal document, not sure what the equivalent is in the US) and had it notarized by my lawyer. I uploaded it to my case and within 2 days it was closed and I was reimbursed the original sale price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFWIW they don't have the resources to deal with this type of scam, but if you are able to get a police report or any sort of legal letter supporting your side of the story, they'll just eat the cost and refund both parties.",
