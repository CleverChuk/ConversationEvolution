                "body":"A family member owns 20 acres of land that unfortunately happened to be in the way of one of the California wildfires. The guy is ok, and pretty shaken up, but he left long before the fire reached his land. When the clean-up starts, the city/state/whoever (please correct me on this if I'm wrong) will want the land cleared of the burnt debris, which includes a ton of burnt/half burnt trees. I know that Reddit takes tree law very seriously, so I wanted to see what you guys thought of the situation.\n\nShould my family member get someone to assess the damage to the property independently from whomever comes to clean the land up? Or is the process pretty set in stone? He basically lived in a forest, so over the 20 acres of land, there must have been 100+ trees on the property, and most - if not all - are gone. I am admittedly ignorant of this whole process, and I just want to make sure we do everything right during the aftermath. Any tips or recommendations would be wonderful in this tough situation.",

Not to mention the local appeals for evacuee and animal rescue help. And many, many \"have you seen my mother?\" requests. \n\nOne big thing in terms of coverage is the cachet of Malibu and the fact that (gasp!) celebrities live there. The TV stations in the LA area are for the most part well-funded and those news helicopters can provide a lot of footage. \n\nThe main coverage of the Camp Fire has been a local newspaper and two small TV stations--all of which have done heroic jobs in the face of small staff, lousy budgets, and their own staff loss of homes & loved ones. \n\nThe median household income in Paradise is something like $47,000.

The two of you are certainly able to come to an agreement on what to do when it is repaired, but if the unit is damaged and repairs require the tenant vacate, the lease is considered broken by merit of the landlord being literally unable to uphold their end of it by no fault of theirs. This inalidates any lease that does not have a specific clause that describes what temporary accommodation or adjustment is made in the event the unit is rendered uninhabitable AND in need to major repair. I have never seen such a clause in 22 years of practicing housing/tenancy law.  \n\nThe landlord can not charge you contuned rent from the day the unit is unlivable, and must return your deposit and prorated rent within 21 days. But you are powerless to tell them that you do not want to break the lease. It was broken when the property was destroyed and the landlord lost their ability to provide a habitable premises. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of lousy news, and this is actually a common desire when rented homes are damaged like this. People tend to like their home and want to return to it when repaired. Unfortunately, you and your landlord must *mutually* agree to suspend the contract/extend the right of first refusal to you to relet. But without knowing the extent of damage or repair timeline, any contract promising to let you return, especially with a timeline, is not prudent for the landlord to make and their lawyer (or common sense) will advise against it.  \n\nBest of luck, and I am very sorry to learn you've been impacted in this way.

I apologize for the confusion.  \n\nSo, it depends. The landlord is still not at fault for being unable to provide a habitable unit. You can not be required to pay rent during the time the unit is uninhabitable, as well. So it is up to you and the landlord to decide jointly if you want to wait it out and be entitled to refunded rent for days you have no access or if you want to break the lease. The right granted in these circumstances is breaking it (as opposed to forcing the other party to remain bound by the lease) if the repairs can not be done in a reasonable length of time, which will be measured in days and not weeks/months. \n\nI would suggest you be very proactive in deciding what you would like to do and reach out to them as soon as possible and stay in daily contact. They can't control the timeline, and since they don't need to do repairs, I would suspect they would be happy to allow you back once functional again. It does not make much sense to me why they would not. They also do not have to/(let you) break the lease immediately. But once the lines are down for about a week or two, either one of you will be able to walk away without penalty or consent of the other.  It's just not possible to put a pin in exactly what day that is; the law does not define such things. The term is \"reasonable,\" which varies by exact circumstance. But for the time you are out, you do not need to pay rent. \n\nI fully appreciate that the daily rent cost tends to be less than it is costs to stay in a hotel or Airbnb or whatever. This is especially true when everything is full. I hope you have been able to secure accommodation, that you and your family and friends are all safe and you had adequate rental insurance or resources to carry you until settled back in your home, or a new one. Stay safe, and I wish you the best. ",

I think you're doing everything right in terms of documenting evidence, etc. Since the neighbor had a survey done that shows the trees on your property, you're probably in the clear. It's probable that the surveyor measured the tree locations during his survey, if the neighbor notified him that was the purpose of the survey.\n\nIt could be possible, although unlikely, that the surveyor made a mistake, and the neighbor could hire a different surveyor and see if there was any cause for uncertainty. Surveyors are required to be impartial, and to find the truth of the situation, regardless of whether it helps their client or not. I'm guessing the surveyor is getting flak from the neighbor for finding a 'bad' result for him. Those are the worst clients, and we've been stiffed on payment and threatened with lawsuits for recovering monuments in the correct place, but where the client didn't want them to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes people are just mean, and will try to take it out on their neighbors. You aren't under any obligation to share in the cost of his survey or to build a new fence. I don't think you have anything to worry about unless he actually files a suit, but if you're worried, consulting with a decent real estate attorney in your area would not be a bad idea.",

                "body":"Just FYI, GPS and satellite imagery (I assume that's what you mean by satellite) aren't *that* accurate unless you've got really high-end equipment. Most standard GPS units can reliably get you within a couple meters, but even then, that's within the margin of error for your 3ft-away and 6ft-away trees. Satellite imagery can also be misaligned from its real-world location by several meters, and I have some potentially unfounded concerns about the accuracy of spatial measurements in some free software (specifically Google Earth).\n\nNow, the property stakes are a different story. If you ID'd them correctly and measured from there, that *should* be an accurate measurement. However, you said your neighbor hired a surveyor, and the survey either proved that the trees were further into your yard than you'd thought (your interpretation) or that the trees are on your neighbor's property (their interpretation). The survey is only going to support one of those interpretations, and figuring out which one it is is VITAL. In a lawsuit, \"common sense\" measurements and you measuring the boundary stakes aren't going to hold up against an assessment from a professional surveyor, so you need to be sure that the surveyor's report supports your interpretation. It may also benefit you to get your own survey done, to make sure your neighbor isn't pulling any funny business.\n\nIf the surveyor's report supports your interpretation, you should be covered. You're allowed to cut down your own trees. If your neighbor is an attorney, I would be surprised if they actually file suit if the survey shows they're wrong. \n\nIf the surveyor's report supports your neighbor's interpretation, you should probably lawyer up. IANAL, but it seems like the tree law frequently cited on here typically says that someone who cuts down their neighbor's trees has to pay damages to replace the tree, and replacing a mature tree is very (veryveryvery) expensive. However, your neighbor's damages may be limited if the trees were truly dead; that's a question for a lawyer and an arborist. I don't think \"but the trees were a hazard to my house\" is justification to cut your neighbor's trees down, but again, the conditions under which that may or may not be an allowable excuse in your jurisdiction are a question for a lawyer.",

He came onto their property and ranted/raved like a lunatic that they are not allowed to cut , some claim to a non existent HAO bylaw (HOA was kicked out in 89) and that the tree company only wants to take all the trees for wood and profit. This kicked it off. he walked back and found my wife and one kid waiting for the other to get off the bus and began accosting her. Threatened to sue.

My neighbor says he is suing**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> I can't find any legal precedent for this. I knew where the property stakes were and the 3 trees that were in various states of decay were 3,6 and 20 ft on my side of the property line indicated by both satelite, gps and the actual property stakes. My neighbor - a litigator and attorney demands compensation for his trees. He then commissioned a survey that identified other stakes and the rest of the boundaries. The trees were actually further into my property. He accosted my wife at the mailbox saying we had no right to take his trees and they are on his property. He now wants me to pay for his survey, a new fence and \"his trees\".  Should I be overly concerned about how this would play out in court. All 3 trees were leaning over my house in excess of 60-100 ft. All were dead with one in an advanced state of decay. When the tree company removed them I specifically had them left on my property in view in the event that something like this happened because my neighbor is a known crazy person. So to reiterate. Trees are well within my property confirmed by \"common sense\" and an actual survey paid for by my neighbor in an attempt to claim ownership of them. Trees are dead and dangerous - considered a hazard by my insurance company . I paid a significant amount of money to remove them. My neighbor says he is going to file a lawsuit over it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
