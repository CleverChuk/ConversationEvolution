                "body":"A family member owns 20 acres of land that unfortunately happened to be in the way of one of the California wildfires. The guy is ok, and pretty shaken up, but he left long before the fire reached his land. When the clean-up starts, the city/state/whoever (please correct me on this if I'm wrong) will want the land cleared of the burnt debris, which includes a ton of burnt/half burnt trees. I know that Reddit takes tree law very seriously, so I wanted to see what you guys thought of the situation.\n\nShould my family member get someone to assess the damage to the property independently from whomever comes to clean the land up? Or is the process pretty set in stone? He basically lived in a forest, so over the 20 acres of land, there must have been 100+ trees on the property, and most - if not all - are gone. I am admittedly ignorant of this whole process, and I just want to make sure we do everything right during the aftermath. Any tips or recommendations would be wonderful in this tough situation.",

Not to mention the local appeals for evacuee and animal rescue help. And many, many \"have you seen my mother?\" requests. \n\nOne big thing in terms of coverage is the cachet of Malibu and the fact that (gasp!) celebrities live there. The TV stations in the LA area are for the most part well-funded and those news helicopters can provide a lot of footage. \n\nThe main coverage of the Camp Fire has been a local newspaper and two small TV stations--all of which have done heroic jobs in the face of small staff, lousy budgets, and their own staff loss of homes & loved ones. \n\nThe median household income in Paradise is something like $47,000. A quarter of the residents were over age 65 (statewide, it's 10%). The median household income in Malibu is $116,000. \n\nWhat's more telegenic--a Kardashian mansion with flames creeping toward it, or a burning trailerpark?",

The two of you are certainly able to come to an agreement on what to do when it is repaired, but if the unit is damaged and repairs require the tenant vacate, the lease is considered broken by merit of the landlord being literally unable to uphold their end of it by no fault of theirs. This inalidates any lease that does not have a specific clause that describes what temporary accommodation or adjustment is made in the event the unit is rendered uninhabitable AND in need to major repair. I have never seen such a clause in 22 years of practicing housing/tenancy law.  \n\nThe landlord can not charge you contuned rent from the day the unit is unlivable, and must return your deposit and prorated rent within 21 days. But you are powerless to tell them that you do not want to break the lease. It was broken when the property was destroyed and the landlord lost their ability to provide a habitable premises. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of lousy news, and this is actually a common desire when rented homes are damaged like this. People tend to like their home and want to return to it when repaired. Unfortunately, you and your landlord must *mutually* agree to suspend the contract/extend the right of first refusal to you to relet. But without knowing the extent of damage or repair timeline, any contract promising to let you return, especially with a timeline, is not prudent for the landlord to make and their lawyer (or common sense) will advise against it.  \n\nBest of luck, and I am very sorry to learn you've been impacted in this way.

I apologize for the confusion.  \n\nSo, it depends. The landlord is still not at fault for being unable to provide a habitable unit. You can not be required to pay rent during the time the unit is uninhabitable, as well. So it is up to you and the landlord to decide jointly if you want to wait it out and be entitled to refunded rent for days you have no access or if you want to break the lease. The right granted in these circumstances is breaking it (as opposed to forcing the other party to remain bound by the lease) if the repairs can not be done in a reasonable length of time, which will be measured in days and not weeks/months. \n\nI would suggest you be very proactive in deciding what you would like to do and reach out to them as soon as possible and stay in daily contact. They can't control the timeline, and since they don't need to do repairs, I would suspect they would be happy to allow you back once functional again. It does not make much sense to me why they would not. They also do not have to/(let you) break the lease immediately. But once the lines are down for about a week or two, either one of you will be able to walk away without penalty or consent of the other.  It's just not possible to put a pin in exactly what day that is; the law does not define such things. The term is \"reasonable,\" which varies by exact circumstance. But for the time you are out, you do not need to pay rent. \n\nI fully appreciate that the daily rent cost tends to be less than it is costs to stay in a hotel or Airbnb or whatever. This is especially true when everything is full. I hope you have been able to secure accommodation, that you and your family and friends are all safe and you had adequate rental insurance or resources to carry you until settled back in your home, or a new one. Stay safe, and I wish you the best. ",
