Currently, it is legal. Th company may have to meet other requirements to cancel, but they can certainly refuse to renew. \n\nThere are basically two choices. Get a high-risk policy from a company that writes those. They can be expensive. The companies that write them may not be licensed in California. \n\nThe other is to get a [FAIR policy](https://www.cfpnet.com) (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements). This is an insurance consortium that operates similarly to the assigned-risk insurance that drivers with horrible records have to resort to. One problem is that FAIR policies are pretty bare bones. And again, \"properties in brush/wildfire areas may receive a premium higher than one for a property in an urban, non brush/wildfire area.\"\n\n\n\n",

Pretty much every E & S insurance company is around 25% more expensive on average but in CA I have been getting notes on renewals that the rates are increasing anywhere from 100-150%. I have seen a few multi million dollar homes come back with rates of $39k or more. \n\nGiven that it isn't impossible to get insurance from a broker (Burns & Wilcox, RPS, etc) who can try and shop it around for a rate and it could wind up on my desk for example but that might be your best option given you aren't in a cease bind zip code.

The two of you are certainly able to come to an agreement on what to do when it is repaired, but if the unit is damaged and repairs require the tenant vacate, the lease is considered broken by merit of the landlord being literally unable to uphold their end of it by no fault of theirs. This inalidates any lease that does not have a specific clause that describes what temporary accommodation or adjustment is made in the event the unit is rendered uninhabitable AND in need to major repair. I have never seen such a clause in 22 years of practicing housing/tenancy law.  \n\nThe landlord can not charge you contuned rent from the day the unit is unlivable, and must return your deposit and prorated rent within 21 days. But you are powerless to tell them that you do not want to break the lease. It was broken when the property was destroyed and the landlord lost their ability to provide a habitable premises. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of lousy news, and this is actually a common desire when rented homes are damaged like this. People tend to like their home and want to return to it when repaired. Unfortunately, you and your landlord must *mutually* agree to suspend the contract/extend the right of first refusal to you to relet. But without knowing the extent of damage or repair timeline, any contract promising to let you return, especially with a timeline, is not prudent for the landlord to make and their lawyer (or common sense) will advise against it.  \n\nBest of luck, and I am very sorry to learn you've been impacted in this way.

I apologize for the confusion.  \n\nSo, it depends. The landlord is still not at fault for being unable to provide a habitable unit. You can not be required to pay rent during the time the unit is uninhabitable, as well. So it is up to you and the landlord to decide jointly if you want to wait it out and be entitled to refunded rent for days you have no access or if you want to break the lease. The right granted in these circumstances is breaking it (as opposed to forcing the other party to remain bound by the lease) if the repairs can not be done in a reasonable length of time, which will be measured in days and not weeks/months. \n\nI would suggest you be very proactive in deciding what you would like to do and reach out to them as soon as possible and stay in daily contact. They can't control the timeline, and since they don't need to do repairs, I would suspect they would be happy to allow you back once functional again. It does not make much sense to me why they would not. They also do not have to/(let you) break the lease immediately. But once the lines are down for about a week or two, either one of you will be able to walk away without penalty or consent of the other.  It's just not possible to put a pin in exactly what day that is; the law does not define such things. The term is \"reasonable,\" which varies by exact circumstance. But for the time you are out, you do not need to pay rent. \n\nI fully appreciate that the daily rent cost tends to be less than it is costs to stay in a hotel or Airbnb or whatever. This is especially true when everything is full. I hope you have been able to secure accommodation, that you and your family and friends are all safe and you had adequate rental insurance or resources to carry you until settled back in your home, or a new one. Stay safe, and I wish you the best. ",

It is crucial that you do not blab on inappropriately about her past, otherwise you may seem like a grieving irrational son.

It would help if the police gave you some proof that you\u2019d been there and gave them \u201cevidence\u201d. You can show it to the doctor so he takes you more seriously, in case he isn\u2019t.\nLastly, inform the social workers and nurses of the event and your last two steps so that they are aware of the wife, so they keep an eye on her if you are not around.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.

It\u2019s likely that they can\u2019t or won\u2019t do anything with it. Why? Because they don\u2019t know where it came from. The chain was of custody hasn\u2019t been established beyond hearsay and it\u2019s very week evidence. 2)  You\u2019re going to run into issues having it tested on your own. Forensic labs won\u2019t touch anything without a lawyer being involved and the testing going to be expensive. 3) The doctors may test but will be hesitant because they are now getting involved in a possible criminal case. Doctors don\u2019t want to get dragged to court to testify about something they had tested.  The medical lab doesn\u2019t want to be involved in testing something that may become evidence of a crime at some point. There\u2019s a lot that goes into handling and testing evidence and I would be surprised if they want to be involved in that sort of thing.\n\nIn short have the police collect a sample and it will make life easier, but don\u2019t be surprised if they won\u2019t.",

I managed to procure specimen in question. What do I do now?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> Not sure if this is the right subreddit. Sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and I don't know what to do. Let me break down some background first: \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> My dad is currently dying of liver failure. He's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  We have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. The man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. He's taking light doses of morphine and Lorazepam so that he can sleep. The consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to Thanksgiving....\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> My step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  There was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (My dad would be the 5th man)\n> \n> She's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. NOT through any Vet or other official. She is barred from EVERY animal shelter and adoption agency in the STATE as a result. \n> \n> So with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> She brought in a \"home-made\" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. He was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. In a matter of LESS THAN A MINUTE after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction I've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. Before I even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) \"Do you see the light yet??? Do you see all the pretty angels??\" (WTF????). He's been in an essentially catatonic state since. Out cold for the past 12 hours. It was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. In tears, I begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. I was truly scared and genuinely thought I was going to lose him right then and there. We called Hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. They are on staff 24/7). She wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs. \n> \n> But he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and NOTHING like this has ever happened. I'm just a lay person, but that did NOT seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened IMMEDIATELY following the food, like flipping a light switch. \n> \n> Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe i'm reading too much into it.  But I managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. My first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? Is that even a thing? Do I take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? A hospital? \n> \n> With him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing?? \n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n>  Again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, I probably wouldn't think anything of it....\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> Any and all feedback would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
