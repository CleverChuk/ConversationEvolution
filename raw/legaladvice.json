Because of a history of child stars being exploited by their parents, California law makes clear that earnings by minors in the entertainment industry are the property of the minor, not their parents. Since a minor cannot legally control their own money, California Law governs their earnings and creates a fiduciary relationship between the parent and the child. California law also requires that 15% of all minors\u2019 earnings must be set aside in a blocked trust account commonly known as a Coogan Account.\n\nPlease contact SAG-AFTRA Young Performers Committee or your agent, and they should hook you up with an attorney.",

If I was OP\u2019s 2nd AD (often the point of contact for actors on a job), I would be more than happy to share the SAG reps name and number.\n\nAlso, the minor in California has a tutor assigned to them that are supposed to act as constant reps for them on set as well, and has quick access to SAG and the contract. As long as this person isn\u2019t in your parent\u2019s pocket, the tutor would be the first person I might turn to, to be lead in the correct direction.\n\nEdit: IANAL but I\u2019m a 2nd Assistant Director. I\u2019m responding because your legal advice is the most direct and responsible comment out of everything here. I\u2019m adding ways to get in contact with SAG if the minor is currently on set as there are people already on set supposed to be watching out for their welfare.",

You should find yourself a lawyer to investigate this, someone not associated with your family, your families lawyer or your manager. You state that even without your income, your family would be considered upper middle class, and that you make more than your parents; that would probably put your annual income in the 6 figures, so you shouldn't have trouble getting a lawyer to take the case on contingency (that is, they only get paid if you win).\n\n* Your manager does not appear to have your best interests at heart. Taking a guess, I figure that with you being underage, your parents have a significant amount of control over whether you continue to work in your industry, and your manager gets paid whether or not you have control over your money. Thus, his best course is to keep you working by any means necessary, including lying to you.\n\n* Finally, familiarize yourself with [California Child Actor's Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Child_Actor%27s_Bill). It was created specifically for circumstances like yourself; to protect child actors earnings from their parents. This is definitely something to bring up with your meeting with **your** lawyer. ",

Go through SAG first if you can, they'll be able to hook you up with someone who does exactly this kind of thing. The lawyer will be happy to work for some of the money that you'll be getting back from your father so it's ok that you don't have any money now.\n\nAfter you get the money back, you should look into emancipation. Then your parents will have no rights to any of your new accounts, records, property, etc. It shouldn't be that hard as long as you're making enough to support yourself. If you don't make a ton, getting a side gig for when you're not working would be a good idea too.\n\nFinally, put some of your money in a trust that pays it out to your steadily over a long period of time, or that you can't touch for a long time. You have no idea if you'll still be acting at 26 and you might want to go to college or something. Also real estate in CA is nuts expensive, it's nice to be able to afford a house especially when you want kids and need the room, maybe around age 36. What I'm saying is 16 year olds don't have as many expensive needs as older people so saving the majority of your money (after your basic living expenses) is the smart move. Or at the very least, a trust that pays you out steadily will prevent you from going broke if you're between jobs for too long or have unexpected expenses.",

In addition, he's spending it on himself.**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> *I didn't know what flair to use, if the one I chose is wrong my apologies, I will change it. Also sorry for the novel*\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> I'm sorry for this being so long, I've rewritten this three times now trying to avoid adding certain details but they're just unavoidable. So, third time's the charm:\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> I am a minor in the entertainment industry. While certainly not a J Law or Swift, I am in the public eye. I still live with my family (in America). Recently (I don't want to say how recent), I've found success, and am now making more money than my parents combined. This doesn't sit well with them. They aren't poor but also aren't rich, I would consider us an \"Upper Middle Class\" family not counting my income.  As time has gone on and I've found more success and as such made more money, they have become increasingly bitter about it. Last week my father stopped just being bitter.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> My father created my bank accounts when I was young. He's my parent so I never saw any reason to not trust him, until now. Five days ago my father closed my accounts and transferred all of my money to himself. I told him that was illegal but he said he's my legal guardian and has the right to decide if I'm mature enough to handle my own money or not. He told me my recent purchase of a new three thousand dollar TV (which was for the family living room) was proof I wasn't capable of being responsible with that amount of money, and so he was going to watch over it for me until I was of age. My mother is, if not complicit, in denial. She refuses to talk with me about it and tells me I don't know what I'm talking about.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> Since my father took the money, he's been getting a lot of nice things, including a very expensive new watch, a new couch set for his space, and as of this morning a new, fairly expensive car, and I know he didn't have enough on his own for any of those. I don't know about the watch or car but I found a copy of the delivery slip that said \"No returns or refunds\" which he had signed. It was $15,000 alone.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> I know the best course of action is to get the police involved but there are two problems with that. For one, while not *critical,* having this known to the public would do a lot more harm. I know that may seem ridiculous but if at all possible I want to keep this from getting out there, which is why I'm on Reddit anonymously. Grasping at straws, I know.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> The problem that's a lot more pressing, is that anyone who could side with me won't. We have a family lawyer who I've been acquainted with and have the contact information for, but they're a family friend with my parents and I've never personally needed their services so I can't see them helping me against my parents. Especially considering I now have nothing to pay them with. I do have a manager, and they were the first person I called. We met at their office four days ago and without actually saying it, they told me in painfully clear terms that if I wanted any more of a career I would accept that my father has only my best interests at heart, and would drop it. I am NOT accusing my manager of anything to be clear here, but there's no denying they have no interest in helping me, whatever their reasons may be.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> The only person helping me is my close friend who's my age, but all they can do is help me think up a solution. It was their suggestion to come here though, because we have no idea what the best course of action is.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> There's another major hitch, that being while i *should* have more money coming in next week, it would have been transferred straight to my bank account. Seeing as that doesn't exist anymore I have no idea if I'll even be able to get any of that money. I tried asking my manager about this but was given a \"don't you worry about that dear,\" type of response and nothing more.\n> \n> &amp;#x200B;\n> \n> Am I screwed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Best of luck.\n\nEdit: I should say I agree with everyone else that you should talk to a lawyer and not take this lying down.
