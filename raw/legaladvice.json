Currently, it is legal. Th company may have to meet other requirements to cancel, but they can certainly refuse to renew. \n\nThere are basically two choices. Get a high-risk policy from a company that writes those. They can be expensive. The companies that write them may not be licensed in California. \n\nThe other is to get a [FAIR policy](https://www.cfpnet.com) (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements). This is an insurance consortium that operates similarly to the assigned-risk insurance that drivers with horrible records have to resort to. One problem is that FAIR policies are pretty bare bones. And again, \"properties in brush/wildfire areas may receive a premium higher than one for a property in an urban, non brush/wildfire area.\"\n\n\n\n",

Pretty much every E & S insurance company is around 25% more expensive on average but in CA I have been getting notes on renewals that the rates are increasing anywhere from 100-150%.

Not to mention the local appeals for evacuee and animal rescue help.

The TV stations in the LA area are for the most part well-funded and those news helicopters can provide a lot of footage. \n\nThe main coverage of the Camp Fire has been a local newspaper and two small TV stations--all of which have done heroic jobs in the face of small staff, lousy budgets, and their own staff loss of homes & loved ones. \n\nThe median household income in Paradise is something like $47,000.

The two of you are certainly able to come to an agreement on what to do when it is repaired, but if the unit is damaged and repairs require the tenant vacate, the lease is considered broken by merit of the landlord being literally unable to uphold their end of it by no fault of theirs. This inalidates any lease that does not have a specific clause that describes what temporary accommodation or adjustment is made in the event the unit is rendered uninhabitable AND in need to major repair. I have never seen such a clause in 22 years of practicing housing/tenancy law.  \n\nThe landlord can not charge you contuned rent from the day the unit is unlivable, and must return your deposit and prorated rent within 21 days. But you are powerless to tell them that you do not want to break the lease. It was broken when the property was destroyed and the landlord lost their ability to provide a habitable premises. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of lousy news, and this is actually a common desire when rented homes are damaged like this. People tend to like their home and want to return to it when repaired. Unfortunately, you and your landlord must *mutually* agree to suspend the contract/extend the right of first refusal to you to relet. But without knowing the extent of damage or repair timeline, any contract promising to let you return, especially with a timeline, is not prudent for the landlord to make and their lawyer (or common sense) will advise against it.  \n\nBest of luck, and I am very sorry to learn you've been impacted in this way.

I apologize for the confusion.  \n\nSo, it depends. The landlord is still not at fault for being unable to provide a habitable unit. You can not be required to pay rent during the time the unit is uninhabitable, as well. So it is up to you and the landlord to decide jointly if you want to wait it out and be entitled to refunded rent for days you have no access or if you want to break the lease. The right granted in these circumstances is breaking it (as opposed to forcing the other party to remain bound by the lease) if the repairs can not be done in a reasonable length of time, which will be measured in days and not weeks/months. \n\nI would suggest you be very proactive in deciding what you would like to do and reach out to them as soon as possible and stay in daily contact. They can't control the timeline, and since they don't need to do repairs, I would suspect they would be happy to allow you back once functional again. It does not make much sense to me why they would not. They also do not have to/(let you) break the lease immediately. But once the lines are down for about a week or two, either one of you will be able to walk away without penalty or consent of the other.  It's just not possible to put a pin in exactly what day that is; the law does not define such things. The term is \"reasonable,\" which varies by exact circumstance. But for the time you are out, you do not need to pay rent. \n\nI fully appreciate that the daily rent cost tends to be less than it is costs to stay in a hotel or Airbnb or whatever. This is especially true when everything is full. I hope you have been able to secure accommodation, that you and your family and friends are all safe and you had adequate rental insurance or resources to carry you until settled back in your home, or a new one. Stay safe, and I wish you the best. ",

If you know what county this teacher is now working/living, I would encourage you to file a report with that county. In terms of contacting your LOCAL police department, you can certainly do this however I have seen these reports often get misplaced or sent to the wrong jurisdiction. Please file a report with the police department where the abuse happened. This will ensure it gets to the right jurisdiction.\n\n",

IE if there is a teacher, therapist, counselor, clergy, or someone who works with youth that you think you could talk to openly about what happened, they should be able to help.\n\n As for the possession of child porn, you are over thinking it. Unless you were also distributing the images (which it does not sound like it) I don't know of any prosecutor who would bring charges against a victim of child porn. The images will however be taken from you as evidence to use against the teacher.",

The police, and children's aid/advocate agencies will take your claim seriously as more children are in imminent harm.\n\nHowever, there are situations where despite evidence of abuse, criminal charges may not be levied against the abuser. And also, charges do not guarantee a conviction. You've been incredibly brave reaching out to everyone here for help. Keeping this courage close [to]* your heart, consider how your emotional and mental health may change over time through this process. \n\nI recommend reaching out to RAINN (their online messaging helpline is great for finding therapeutic and self-care resources), and looking in your local area for therapists who can help you process, unpack, and contextualize what you're going through. They can help keep you grounded.\n\n*Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that my inbox is always open to you. I can listen when you need an ear, and I can also talk to you about the process of finding a therapist or  trauma counselor (and what you can  generally expect when you first meet - mostly they will follow your lead and, without exception, will respect your boundaries and your comfort levels). I'm not a therapist, simply a person with childhood traumas and firsthand experience of the reporting/victim advocacy/trauma counseling system. \n\n* ***NB*** If I can help at all I would like to, keeping in mind that your participation in reporting the teacher is entirely voluntary. Sigh. I understand that acute, fulminant, malignant mix of guilt and shame that shears apart your insides at the knowledge that your own abuser is likely inflicting that abuse onto other kids. And, unfortunately, have experienced the despondency when despite my best efforts the abuser remains free. However, I did not have the kind of clear evidence you do possess. I have so much hope in my heart for you and your journey. \ud83d\udc9c You'll come out of this on the other side with more freedom and stability than you've had in years. I applaud your strength thus far!\n\n* ***NBB*** To those two anonymous gilders: THANK YOU, that's super sweet of you! If you happen to have a safe location or a PO box or something like that, and would like to request a knit winter scarf or hat be mailed to them for Christmas, let me know!  I'm sending this message to your Anon PMs as well. You guys rewarded me so I want to reciprocate as a thank you.\n\n**Please include**: Address, nickname, choose scarf/hat, approximate size, top 3 colours, pattern if you have one in mind, and do you have any natural or synthetic fiber allergies?",

But this doesn\u2019t mean that reporting it won\u2019t help in preventing it from happening to someone else. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of you still having the pictures. On the whole I think you\u2019ll be okay but child pornography law and how people who have it are treated is a very sticky subject. You need someone who is well versed in this area to help. \n\nI would also suggest being ready to reach out to a lawyer.

                "body":"I am a lawyer in Colorado, but I do not do this type of work. Look for someone who works with abuse victims. You likely do not want a criminal defense attorney, as even though they will be more familiar with the prosecutor and police they don't typically work with victims. A simple Google search will result in a number of attorneys in Colorado that work with abuse victims, even child victims. The Rocky Mountain Victim Law Center is a Denver-based non-profit that works with victims of abuse.\n\nAs many others have said, contact RAINN. They will be able to help you through every step of the process. After you have sat down with your attorney, you will go to the police, or it may go straight to the district attorney's office, since the evidence is already gathered.\n\nAs far as who to get as an attorney, you want someone that you are comfortable with. This is paramount. You will have to go though your story, and those photos, many, many times. It will likely be very difficult to do. Your attorney will be with you every step of the way, as will the prosecutor. Remember, though, the prosecutor represents the state, not you. They will be kind, and definitely interested in Justice for you, but will not put you first, as that is not their job.",

You are a victim and you deserve justice. The monster who did this to you deserves forever jail time. Just a hole in the ground somewhere and sometimes food gets dumped in kind of jail. _You have done NOTHING wrong._\n\nThat said, please, PLEASE do not begin the process of obtaining justice by talking to the police. The cops mostly want to help you, they're going to see you as a victim. But walking into a police station and admitting to having child porn is maybe top 5 worst possible ideas. I understand this is scary and counterintuitive.\n\n_YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A LAWYER!_\n\nOther posters have suggested helpful resources if you can't afford a lawyer or need help locating the proper one. Use that! Go to a lawyer and explain everything to them. They will interact with the police and prosecutors either for you, or with you. They will not only protect you from misguided retaliation, whether it might have happened or not, they will also _vastly_ increase the chances of bringing justice to your abuser.\n\n_BASICALLY, GO STRAIGHT TO LAWYER DO NOT PASS GO._\n\nLawyer.

As you are now an adult and the abuse is not ongoing, they are bound by patient confidentiality. It doesn't matter that you are male and your abuser is female. Abuse is abuse. You are brave for wanting to keep other children from suffering and for that, I applaud you. \n\nAs you already have access to a counselor, I would speak to them about this first. Aside from being able to help guide you through the reporting process, they will be able to help you with the scars the abuse has given you. You were a child. Your abuser was in a position of authority. She used psychological manipulation to intimidate you so you wouldn't report her. Many abusers do this. You need not feel guilty for having not mentioned it before. \n\nI would also seek legal counsel before involving the police, just to keep yourself protected. Look for a lawyer that specializes in child abuse or sexual abuse cases. \n\nI would definitely keep seeing your therapist during and after this whole ordeal so they can help you sort through the inevitable mental anxiety you will go through. But please don't let that fear/apprehension/anxiety stop you. You are right to report this disgusting person, to keep her from ever touching another child again. Let that fuel you as you pursue justice for yourself, and safety for others. ",

Here is their office website: https://coag.gov/resources/victim-assistance. \n\nYou do not need a lawyer, though you could retain one if you wanted to help you through the process. It will not make you look guilty, many people do this. \n\nYou will in no way be charged with possession of child pornography. Put that out of your mind, you did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nNormal procedure is to call, or go into, your local police station and request to speak to a detective in sex crimes and report the crime.

                "body":"The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.300172817 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

It is not outside the realm of possibilities the photo goes missing or ends up somewhere it shouldn't be.  If the OP hung on  to the picture this long in hopes of one day using it for proof against her, a backup is a good security measure considering the alternative.\n\nAlso, I would like to say WTF kind of twistedness is it to give a child a photo of you abusing them?

Meaning, note when you reported this to the police and make additional copies of every document.  *Especially* the photos. I know you don\u2019t want your eyes (let alone anyone else\u2019s) on them as much as possible, but I strongly suggest either scanning them or making physical copies, just so they don\u2019t get lost in limbo.\n\nI enjoy Colorado, but there is still some lax behavior from some of the police departments, it\u2019s also okay to find a witness like a psychiatrist. Not a witness to the deeds, but someone who you can identifiably say has also been informed and knows of the situation and that it is being reported by you. \n\nYou want the report to be at the forefront of the primary investigators mind, just so it isn\u2019t lost. Which it probably won\u2019t be. I don\u2019t know where you are in Colorado (don\u2019t tell me) but some places have speedier processes than other, but it\u2019s a great place to be safe if you feel in danger. The police can help no matter what. \n\nAlso, if you have drastic concerns regarding your rights or the laws in Colorado (which are in your favor as a victim), Colorado has many many online resources including [Lexis Nexus](http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/michie/) reference to all the laws of Colorado (Colorado revised statutes), and the Judicial/Court systems website has many many forms if you feel your process needs your own attention.  \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to call the cops, and don\u2019t be afraid to find mental health help for you or anyone affected. If you feel like it\u2019s a barrier, go to your districts community center or outreach center and ask for Counselor services for youths. There are many that can help. \n\n**Edit:** remember 911 is for emergency or aid services. They don\u2019t usually help you with things in the past, but if you don\u2019t have access to the internet or a police departments phone number, it\u2019s okay to dial them **in this instance** don\u2019t be afraid to dial it, but remember that it\u2019s best saved for true emergencies. If you have suspicion that an abuse is imminent within the day, you can also use it that way, but it\u2019s much better if you directly call the police department and leave the emergency line clear for near and true life and death situations. (Such as crashes, fires, danger will robinson etc.) Yet they will direct you to the proper line if you can\u2019t find one. \n\nHere\u2019s a good example of a service people forget. If you are old and frail and a fire alarm Is going off in your home and you can\u2019t get it, it\u2019s okay to call the fire department for help. Just remember to try to call them rather than emergency services. **Each of These services will help you find other forms of help when you don\u2019t know where to turn.**\n\n\nEdit: as other have mentioned contact [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/)\n\n[RAINN COLORADO RESOURCES](https://www.rainn.org/laws-your-state-colorado)\nState issued: **A hot line for abuse reporting is available in Colorado**\nThe Colorado Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, 1-844-CO-4-Kids or 1-844-264-5437\n\nAlso here is the COLORADO COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT: 303.839.9999",
