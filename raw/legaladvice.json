I think about my attacker from time to time. I was only 5 or 6 but still, I wonder if I should have done more to stop him. Not sure what more is. I guess you can ask yourself if you see breaking news of a Maryland Police officer that is accused of rape and it turns out to be him will that impact how you cope? It is not your responsibility to stop them but what they did is not some prank. Even if you decided you were going to bang 5 guys for your first time and gonna do it blackout drunk they are still guilty of the child porn and distribution of it. That police officer had to pass a lie detector test about any criminal or wrongdoings and he has somehow done it.  He sounds like a serial criminal.",

Police Internal Affairs Bureau (that\u2019s what it\u2019s called in my area) can sometimes take a dim view on police sexual assault cases. \n\nThird, act quickly. If he is on probation he will be treated less kindly. \n\nFourth, you don\u2019t need a lawyer yet. That\u2019s for when you want to sue which you will shortly but right now just get the criminal investigation going. Once that is going lawyers will be dying to get this case on a contingency.  Only take a contingency lawyer. Any lawyer who is worthwhile won\u2019t need you to pay an hourly rate.  \n\nFifth, but actually most important, please go for counseling. You sound very strong but this is a profoundly difficult situation that you shouldn\u2019t have to navigate alone. The prosecutors office will probably have counseling referrals. Please don\u2019t turn them down. \n\nGood luck and remember that you are never alone.

I didn\u2019t tell a soul for five years. This man just became a police officer, and I feel the need to step forward. Where do I go from here?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> I was at a party during my freshman year of high school. I drank too much and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the basement, naked and covered in bruises. Later found out that three boys from the party (my \u201cfriends\u201d at the time) took turns having sex with me while Police Officer filmed.\n> \n> The following morning, one boy posted a screenshot on Twitter where he texted a girl \u201cYoooo I just fucked a virgin last night and she didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d \n> \n> I know the videos were sent to a few different people from my high school. A boy once came up to me and said he \u201csaw those hot videos from Rapist\u2019s party.\u201d\n> \n> I (perhaps selfishly) never came forward because I was afraid of the response. Should\u2019ve been more careful, shouldn\u2019t have drank so much, etc. My mother is the only person to know, and I didn\u2019t mention it until about a year ago.\n> \n> I learned from a friend that one of my rapists became a police officer in my state. I feel compelled to do something about this. Where do I begin?\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

If you did a complete file system listing and sorted it by date, what's the oldest thing you'd find? Would you even know what it was? What if you have a habit of migrating personal data from system to system? I *know* I have files on my current system from before even the Athlon XP days. I have no idea what they are, I just know that they're there because I've been forward migrating for *at least* that long. \n\nSo: While CP remains a strict liability item and a 21-year-old is completely fucked if he's in possession of it, I could understand a situation where he *had* possession of it six or seven years ago and just... forgot it was there. It was a video of someone his age, and if he was raised in an environment where women ain't shit, then the video isn't anything special and is conceivably forgettable. Fast forward a few PCs, and ta-da, he's 21.\n\nI guess my whole point is, where is this dude in life now? (OH EM GEEZ WHAT ABOUT TEH MANZ!?) What was his involvement at that time? If his involvement was \"saw a video and did nothing,\" then there are millions of guilty boys who have grown up to be strong allies of and advocates for \\#MeToo and \\#BelieveWomen. I am one of them. Two of my brothers are two more. The silent witness is part of human nature, and to punish it is, in my view, a terrible idea. (It is one reason we have legislated the opposite concept - the mandatory reporter.)\n\n#IF HOWEVER\n\nIf his involvement was actually being part of what was recorded in that video, then FUCKING BURN HIM.\n\n*(I feel the need to disclaim in the strongest terms any possession of any such hypothetical video. The personal connection here is having witnessed such a video in my youth and not having done anything about what I saw. That video, even now twenty years later, continues to shape my views on consent and rape culture. It is easy for me to project a similarly positive personal growth in a hypothetical manner on other men who display similarly positive attitudes toward consent culture.)*\n\n",

I have a six month old Australian Shepherd that is fixed. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.\n> \n> He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about thirty minutes.\n> \n> I first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. They said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.\n> \n> After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.\n> \n> I do not know the logistic of ESD's but I do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. What should I do in this situation? I feel that if I go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume ESD's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Then write down the date and time, and who you spoke with on the same page as the incident you are reporting.\n\nI assume you have a smart phone, carry it with you when you take your dog out to go potty.
