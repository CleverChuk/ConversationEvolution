There are statutes some places preventing sex offenders from working with children or living near schools and parks and whatnot, but I don't know of any legal ground to prosecute a sex offender that have discharged their sentence from simply being around a child.\n\n(Please note, I am not saying this is right or just, I'm not arguing how things ought to be, just saying that in my experience I don't know of any such legal prohibitions.)\n\nOtherwise, your advice is spot on.

Your testimony IS evidence and will be taken as fact unless his lawyers can specifically prove otherwise (unlikely). It is important to get a forensic psychologist who deals with young children to work with your son ASAP. Contact your lawyer first, then cps. With kids, they can\u2019t be interviewed/examined/talked to about these things too many times, for various reasons, so you will want someone who really knows what they\u2019re doing and can testify in court as an expert witness, perhaps not whatever new grad/intern cps has just hired.  Make sure you take notes of everyone you talk to (dates, names, initials, as much in writing as possible). \n\nWhat will happen is this will get referred to the DA and the guy will be arrested. Absolutely make sure everyone knows the gang issues and have lawyers/DA fight that no bail is offered (or super high) due to gang ties. You will also go through the process to get a restraining order/protective order which is usually pretty quick and automatic in these cases, but make sure your info/your sons info is withheld from all documents (like a victim of domestic violence) so no one can trace you. Pretty sure touching little kids is not going to be cool with the gang either, if that gives you a little peace of mind. The fact he has a prior conviction for this is also huge, and most likely he will plea and it will never go to trial. \n\nGet your son into therapy with a PsyD or other highly trained therapist (not licensed marriage and family counselor or others with less training). Know that he WILL be ok, his resilience will amaze you, and you believing him and getting him help will be important down the road for the relationship between you two. You should also get therapy yourself, ASAP. This is a hard, awful thing you\u2019re having to deal with. I\u2019m sending a big internet hug.

My only successes have been going through the vendors and either three-way calling or having my vendors file tickets on my behalf. \n\nSo most shipping companies only want to deal with their customers, which in this case is iBuyPower.\n\nI would believe that the best course is to contact IBP and have them open a ticket with the shipping company regarding the concerns. \n\nIdeally, the machine is a total loss and IBP/shipping company will figure out the insurance situation while IBP delivers  a replacement.",

The pc he ordered was about 800$ and obviously requires signature upon delivery because it\u2019s such an expensive item. He had ordered the pc to his new house that he was moving into but currently not living at. (obviously a mistake on his part because he wouldn\u2019t be there to sign for it) He realized his mistake and called ibuypower to change the shipping address, he looked at the website after the call and the shipping address had changed on his request. Couple days go by and the tracking number says it is out for delivery set to be delivered by end of day. He keeps checking back all day to see if it\u2019s been delivered yet and finally at 9 o\u2019clock at night it said it had been delivered and signed for and he immediately though well that\u2019s pretty odd because I don\u2019t have my pc and never signed for it. He then decides ok so maybe they delivered it to my new house even though I changed the shipping address. He gets there and sees his pc sitting in the rain with his signature forged by the delivery driver the driver even spelled his name wrong. What can he do about this? Also forgot to mention the delivery service was called ontrac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
