The guy is ok, and pretty shaken up, but he left long before the fire reached his land. When the clean-up starts, the city/state/whoever (please correct me on this if I'm wrong) will want the land cleared of the burnt debris, which includes a ton of burnt/half burnt trees. I know that Reddit takes tree law very seriously, so I wanted to see what you guys thought of the situation.\n\nShould my family member get someone to assess the damage to the property independently from whomever comes to clean the land up? Or is the process pretty set in stone? He basically lived in a forest, so over the 20 acres of land, there must have been 100+ trees on the property, and most - if not all - are gone. I am admittedly ignorant of this whole process, and I just want to make sure we do everything right during the aftermath. Any tips or recommendations would be wonderful in this tough situation.",

What\u2019s stopping \u201ccrazy\u201d from coming in one day, whether he is fired or not, and just stabbing him to death? Nothing.\n\nOP, if you\u2019re reading this, QUIT your job. Take this as a big warning. Either way, whether he loses his job or not, he will be coming after you to take out his life\u2019s frustrations on. You\u2019re the perfect target now. \n\nJust FYI, the police aren\u2019t going to protect you (contrary to popular belief here). A restraining order isn\u2019t going to do shit against someone who is bat shit crazy and doesn\u2019t care whether he goes to jail or dies from his repercussions. The cops won\u2019t just hang around your store for a week waiting for this guy to show up. Sadly, these people DO exist in this world and nobody can help you except you yourself. The only way you can do that is by taking yourself out of the environment and letting crazy keep his job and he will forget you ever existed. I HIGHLY recommend you don\u2019t \u201csnitch\u201d him out. That will agitate someone who is mentally ill like him which makes him EXTREMELY unpredictable. \n\nIF you\u2019ve already told on him to your superiors then you better hope they didn\u2019t fire him so you can gather the evidence of the death threats and take them to court for negligence. This way you lose your job but you will be compensated enough until you find your next job because your superiors didn\u2019t create a safe work environment for you despite you proclaiming your worries about \u201ccrazy\u201d \n\nGood luck Op. hope you take my advice ",

I have had someone threaten to kill me, and I have had someone threaten to stab me with a metal object they held in their hand.\n\nIn these situations, awareness is key. Let the police, your parents, other close family, and HR know. Police and human resource departments are specifically there to deal with these kinds of situations.\n\nContacting the police can be a scary task if you have never done so in the past, however it is extremely important those with the ability to act are notified of the situation. Inaction on your part does not mean this person will not act themselves.\n\nThe police will take your statement, which just means recounting each situation in as much detail as possible, and they will determine what they can legally do about this situation. I suggest stopping by the local precinct to make your statement.\n\nIf you are in the united states, there are laws around Threat of Harm, Threatening Behavior, and Death Threats. Under state criminal codes, which do vary by state, threats are considered a criminal offense.\n\nDo not be embarrassed or uncomfortable talking to authorities about this: You are helping ensure your safety and the safety of those around you, which is a noble cause, and they should take you and this person's threats seriously.\n\nChoosing to stay or quit your job is a personal decision. However limiting your contact with this individual should be a priority for your own safety, as it should be for anyone else in contact with this person. \n\nOn a personal experience note, taking self defense classes can help give you a sense of security and control after such a situation and I highly suggest it.\n",

They need to know because they might do the right thing, file a police report, fire him etc and warn other workers.  Your responsibility is to tell them ASAP, but not at risk to yourself.  Also tell all your co-workers, by email or phone, because if you doin't show up he may turn to them for his threats.\n\nBUT Meanwhile, the cops will actually go to the guys house, shake him down a little, and let him know he's on their radar.  That will put a little fear into him that he can't just go around being crazy and threatening people.  If you have enough convincing stories about the guy, they may just get him to confess all or part of it (you'd be surprised how people who are crazy spill the beans to anyone who challenges them, because they feel invincible or they aren't thinking through the consequences).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

This situation has potential for serious catastrophe, as plenty of people and animals have been hurt in warrants served to the wrong house.\n\n* Make a list of every instance of police serving warrants at the house. Dates and times, if possible. \n* Call back to ask who you should send a threat of legal action to. I'm usually not in favor of this tactic, but I doubt you'll be connected with the right people otherwise. Make sure you're polite with everyone.\n* If you can get the right person on the phone, great! Tell them what's happening. They don't want to waste officer's time either.\n* If you can't talk to a higher-up (or even if you do) follow up with a cease and desist letter. I'm not sure if that's the appropriate letter format for this scenario, but you need to take a formal step towards a lawsuit.\n* Hire a lawyer to write up the letter if you can afford it. Either way, be sure to stress that you are interested in settling this politely, without legal action or damages, and ask them to provide some sort of assurance that your house is no longer the address for those warrants.\n* Remember that the police aren't your enemies, the bureaucracy is. You need to connect with a person that can cut through that somehow. Unfortunately, this might mean a lot of phone calls, and even a few more registered letters.\n\nAgain, I hate to be the guy saying \"SUE!\", because I don't think it should come to that. I'm not sure you even have a case for a lawsuit, but \"emotional distress\" is certainly a factor here. Hopefully these steps will be enough to solve it, because I can't imagine living under the constant concern of a SWAT team getting spooked by my dogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The first is sober homes, boarding houses essentially for people trying to stay sober, typically after a residential rehab facility but while still doing outpatient treatment or attending Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings.\n\nAnother option is that the halfway house is a true halfway house, as in half way between prison and home. These are boarding houses for people who are on either parole or probation, the first being them released from prison and the second being instead of prison from what I understand, and typically there's firm rules, moreso than in a sober home, requiring you to work and follow every rule of your parole or probation. Many people who violate parole or probation while living in a halfway house will just grab their stuff and go, rather than have a known address for the police to show up and take them to jail/prison.\n\nOccasionally, people not on parole or probation live in halfway houses, especially after getting out of jail or prison, and violating the house rules will make them homeless.

                "body":"As someone else said, it's lawyer time. For both of you. But there are other things you should do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, the best thing you can do for your sister is hire a lawyer for her that is separate from yours. Why? Because since she is still a minor, this may fall into the realm of financial child abuse AND she may have eligibility for emancipation (according to the Texas statute, she checks all the boxes and that will remedy her need for a guardian to govern her accounts). It's not just the inheritance, it's the fact that you two were coerced and then restricted from access to your financials while they were simultaneously living lavishly. Just because they are your parents, doesn't make them entitled to that money. There may be some considerations made for them paying for housing you two, but if they are on a cruise and telling you that you are poor.......well......I don't think a judge is gonna be too pleased on that note.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that your parents are away and on a cruise, you are gonna want to act very fast to get ahead of them before they come back and attempt to restrict her communications or movements. So in addition to calling two lawyers TODAY and getting in with them before they come back, you will need to do the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Get copies of all important documents for you and your sister from the house. Social security cards, birth certificates, passports, and any and all banking documents related to your banking and/or your sisters. DO NOT TAKE anything that isn't specifically yours or your sister's.\n2. Remove any and all items that belong specifically to you. Don't touch your parents things, even if you believe it was purchased with your money. That can and will be mediated by your lawyer later. Once you have the documents and items, don't return to that house. Not without police escort for your own safety.\n3. Go back to BOA and get a printout of all documents related to those accounts in both your names. She may not be able to do much with the financials at the moment without a legal guardian, BUT she can get all the documents! Have the bank print them all out for you, and stamp them with a date and time of when they were acquired. You want to have everything to include a history or transactions from the beginning of the account to now.\n4. Get your sister a secret cell phone with data and such. Make sure she hides it well and never lets the parents know it exists. Also get her a nice compact portable charger for it. It may not be prudent for her to plug it in, but she needs to keep it charged! She may need it depending on how the parents are going to react. The piggy bank just took a walk and she's close out the door. This is also why she needs her own lawyer. She needs protection. Your parents can't touch you but she is still a minor. Get ahead of this.\n5. Make a plan with your sister about how to handle the parents return. Involve the lawyer in this.\n6. Call CPS. Explain the situation. Make sure that they have a heads up on what is happening. People will act rashly when they are backed into a corner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as if what they did was illegal? I don't know, but a lawyer will. And you need one. Well, two, so your sister can be protected. Good luck. And move quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, quick personal advice: GET A FINANCIAL ADVISER!!!!! You just came into a lot of money with not a lot of experience in governing it. Seek out some help so you manage it wisely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also pull your credit reports and put locks on your credit!!",

At the very least, the attorney will be able to explain the whole situation for you and let you know your rights and obligations as well as examining any potential action you can take to recover misused amounts from your parents (if applicable, and you want to go that route). Given the value you're dealing with, a lawyer is not likely to be a significant expense for you (and if they are, it might be time to reevaluate the situation and consider reducing the scope of representation/switching lawyers). \n\nAs for the little sister question, that's a very sticky situation that will require a lot of very sensitive details to get through and resolve in a meaningful way. For what it's worth, I also take care of a couple of my minor siblings against the express wishes of my parent. However, we are able to make it work through negotiating with the parent. It's not ideal, but it can be done. \n\nI could go more in depth on both of these topics. LMK if you want more info (by responding here, in case not obvious)--happy to expand on this. ",

Although not fully laid out above, there are a number of potential penalizing outcomes here for the parents up to and including criminal action. However, we simply don't have enough information to get into this with any certainty. \n\nAs for the specific question of debt collection, and acknowledging that such a discussion assumes that a court finds that a debt is owed by OP's parents to OP, OP has the same remedies and limitations that any other debt collector would have. He could seize their assets and accounts, garnish their wages and other income, and do anything else that any other collector can do. And further, unlike most debts, it's unlikely that this particular debt would be dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings. \n\nBut still, while it is possible for a debt like this to be a cloud over the parents' heads for the rest of their lives, they can't pay money that they don't have.

If they are also paying off the house and getting a lot of new stuff while going on trips, one could think that the yearly income would be in the neighborhood of at least $100k+++/year.   Also, annuity interest rates are not that high right now - running about 4%apr, and to have an annuity start paying out when you are 16, the payout is going to be rather low (amortized over a standard lifetime) - indicating the cash in the annuity is very substantial - around 7 to 8 figures.\n\nSo, all of that implies that the annuity is for a very healthy sum (7-8 figures), generating a pretty reasonable income.  Both of them need some help, especially with their parents having a bad case of sticky fingers.",

She will just manually transfer the funds leaving just enough in the account to keep it open until she is 18. \n\nIt will take your parents exactly one second to figure out that its a race to the bank between your sister transferring funds, before your parents can get there.  So, they will just set up electronic banking - if they have not already, to get their first.  Your sister's deposits for the next year are at risk, till she turns 18.   Then your parent's party is over.\n\nAn attorney for your sister (that you can pay for) will put a stop to this.\n\n______________________\n\nOk, here is some additional advice, that you have not asked for - but should consider.  \n\n* Sign up to attend a community college.   They are inexpensive and are good quality - and will offer the basic courses that you need right now.  Take just a general major, but what you want to do is to take classes in business law, personal finance, investments, money management, some basic math and statistics, computer software (spreadsheets / microsoft excel), etc.  You want to do this so that you can better understand/evaluate the information you will be receiving from your attorney, financial advisor, and CPA.  The basic math and statistics will be useful in evaluating and understanding your annuities, investments, and their returns.  The computer software classes - excel specifically will help you manage your money and income, do basic budgeting, track your investments and the like.   It will also help you understand your taxes and overall money management.  You can do this easily in a year, and it's essentially investing in yourself.  Education is something that no one can take away from you.  You have both time and money on your side.  Use both of them wisely.\n\n* You and your sister are going to have to look out for each other - no one else will have such a vested interest in you than each other.   There will be a lot of interested folks in being your friends when they find out what you have.   Live beneath your means, and be discrete.  Learn to save.  Don't look prosperous, learn to blend in.  Don't attract attention to yourselves.  You have had to go through some tough lessons from your parents already.   You are not going to be able to depend on your parents for \"life advice\".  You and your sister are going to have to depend on each other - along with the attorneys, financial advisor, and CPA that you surround yourselves with.\n",

I am 18 now and would like to cut them off. Also questions regarding a 17 year olds right to leave home and am I kidnapping?**\r\n\r\nOriginal Post: \r\n\r\n> This is very very long so I will keep it simple. Here is the TL:DR. If someone was specifically stated to be excluded from a will, is it illegal if they set up the interest on annuities paid to their child to go into a joint account with them? Second is it kidnapping if my 17 year old sister wants to leave the home against parent wishes and move in with me?\n> \n> My grandparents died 3 years ago and my parents were left nothing in the will. The will specifically stated they were to get land and nothing more. \n> \n> As for me and my sister, we were set up in a way to help avoid being taxed. I am not entirely sure as to the method that was used, but a trust was setup with annuities and interest payments. I am not too familiar with it but apparently the money in the annuities are static, the interest is paid out from there and that somehow generates less tax responsibility because the annuities are under a certain number and if it goes higher we get taxed more? Not entirely sure on that one. \n> \n> Problem is my parents tricked us into setting up join bank accounts with my mom as the second name on the account. We did not realize that they would gain access to the money from this. \n> \n> We knew something was up when suddenly my parents paid off their house in a lump sum, they turned over 7 cars in a year's time, and they started living very lavishly while trying to lie to us about how impoverished they were. \n> \n> I have checks and a debit card for the account, but my mom keeps those locked in a safe in her room because she can not \"trust me\" with them.\n> \n> While they live in luxury we get nothing. A 50 dollar walmart gift card each year is it. Since the accounts were setup we are not allowed to leave the house at all. Most likely cause they know we can go get money out of the accounts if need be. \n> \n> Until this year my parents left the money alone at tax time so WE could pay the taxes on the interest, but that about all we have been allowed. This year, however, my parents refused to give us the debit cards to our accounts stating that \"money was very tight\" and we would have to \"make do on our own.\" \n> \n> We both walked up to the BOA where our accounts were and got the bank info to set up a bank withdrawal for this year after our friend told us we could do that. \n> \n> Monday was my 18th birthday and because my parents are literally on a cruise right now, this is what I did.   \n> \n> I walked up to the BOA and lied to a banker saying the debit cards on the account were both stolen. This deactivated them. I then made a 500 withdrawal and walked across the street to the chase building to open a new account with the 500 I withdrew from mine. Then using a CD I was able to drain all but 2k from mine. Im leaving just enough so they can make it back home without running out of money. Hopefully. \n> \n> With my newfound money I was able to walk up to the walmart and get myself a smart phone as I have never been allowed to own one. I had to order a taxi to take me to the office of the company that runs my inheritance. Using the banking and routing number I was able to set up a deposit for the new account. \n> \n> After all of this I was able to set up the same thing for my sister as Chase allows minor accounts at 17. Except she is not allowed to touch the inheritance account without guardian permission until she turns 18. \n> \n> So I set her up with online banking and set her up with a gmail account. \n> \n> We get interest payments once a month from the annuities at the exact same time so I was able to show her how to set a bank transfer. She will just manually transfer the funds leaving just enough in the account to keep it open until she is 18. \n> \n> To give you an example of how much money we are talking. I bought a new car cash and that was not even a dent. I also started renting a house and moved in today. My sister wants to move in with me but I have a few questions about that.\n> \n> When they come back from the cruise they WILL forbid her from living with me. So is that kidnapping?\n> \n> Also is what they did illegal? The will specifically stated they were not allowed to get a dime from my grandparents. All the money was set up to flow to me and my sister. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.2836 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

I understand where you're coming from, and honestly I'd be going scorched earth if I were in your shoes, but I hope you can see why this is a bad idea.\n\nIf you're going to teach him anything in preparation, teach him his rights. He doesn't have to answer any questions from police, and he doesn't have to share any passwords. It's sad, but he needs to understand that although the police are important to society, they aren't his friends. If his response to \"where are the guns\" had been to naively tell the police where you keep your guns, that irrelevant answer could've led to life ruining consequences, or at least unimaginable quantities of red tape.\n\nHow is your son handing all this?

That person did the correct thing in reporting it.  \n\nDo you not understand that children are bringing guns to school and shooting people?   \n\nThe problem is that the police should have quickly ascertained that he was talking about NERF guns and a video game.  Better safe than sorry.  \n\nYou know how people shouldn\u2019t \u201cjoke\u201d about having a bomb when they\u2019re in line at an airport because people have to assume you might be serious?   Well the same goes for kids talking about guns at school.  \n\nSo ... teach your kid that he shouldn\u2019t mention shooting guns at school and start a complaint process about the fact that the school didn\u2019t immediately notify you nor were you allowed to be with your child during questioning.  \n\nBut the people reporting hearing the conversation?   They did the right thing. ",

THAT is your takeaway? \n\nPeople calling the cops over nothing is why you are in this mess in the first place.

I agree that education in advance on how to say nothing other than identifying themselves and politely but firmly requesting both a parent and a lawyer be present is also extremely important.     \n\nI do NOT know of a test case where the police have denied a lawyer to a minor when the parents requested it though, and I strongly suspect a court would at least consider a parent invoking their 11 year old's right to have an attorney present vicariously.   If it comes down to trying to get statements thrown out...  the totality of circumstance is considered and everything you can put in the 'questionable behavior by police' column is a plus.  Having your lawyer present is the best way to make certain accessing your child doesn't take a second longer than it has to, and it keeps the department on notice that you're not ignorant bumpkins to be pushed around.",

Lady didn't know how to handle me and kept insisting I didn't have a right to a lawyer. Well I was 15, and stubborn, so my answer never changed and seeing me be so bold my brother began to follow suit.

Two relevant portions:\n\n> (c) A child may not be left unattended in a juvenile\nprocessing office and is entitled to be accompanied by the child's\nparent, guardian, or other custodian or by the child's attorney.\n\n> (d) A child may not be detained in a juvenile processing\noffice for longer than six hours.\n\n[This article](https://mic.com/articles/125434/texas-police-violate-ahmed-mohamed-s-civil-rights-by-keeping-him-from-parents-and-lawyer#.tObbca7Sd) about Ahmed Mohamed's arrest mentions that part of the code.",

California (1966), but telling you \"use your right index finger\" is not communicative and is a physical trait.  In re Boucher clarified that if the police had knowledge of what was on the phone, \"we know there are pictures of the plan, they are photos 100 and 101\" then the foregone conclusion doctrine applies, and the password and fingerprint may be compelled in either instance including the person identifying which finger unlocks the phone.",

I only wanted to point out that there is a public safety exception to the Miranda Rights rule. \n\n>And the third very common one is what we call the public safety exception. And that is a situation where there is an imminent danger to the public. For example, a suspected terrorist is arrested, and the police think that this person knows the whereabouts of a bomb or a terrorist attack is going to take place soon and so they interrogate the person to try to get the critical emergency information. Even if that person has invoked their right to remain silent, the police have some leeway in those situations to continue to question them.\u00a0\n\nIts also possible the search of his phone was lawful due to an exception of \"exigent circumstance\", though that is tough to say because case law involving things like cell phones are fairly new and not all hammered out in clear guidelines.\n\nJuveniles however have many additional rights that adults don't necessarily have, and allowing a parent or guardian to be present is often numero uno. \n\nAgain, Im not saying what they did was lawful or appropriate at all, I just wanted to point those things out as something you can look into in the mean time of acquiring a lawyer.\n\nEdit: Also, even if these things may have come into play, it doesn't mean you're not able to file a lawsuit. It is up to a judge to determine whether or not their actions were lawful based on these exceptions and not a violation of civil rights. ",

As sad as it is, you have to teach your child what words are acceptable to use at school. When kids interact with each other they often exaggerate and a teacher may have heard something that did not paint them in a good light. The school definitely mishandled the situation by not contacting you but as a parent you have to sadly teach your child that not using certain terms at school is part of social awareness nowadays. If I was in that situation and had overheard any conversation like the one your child had, they would have been pulled aside for a one on one conversation and a conference with the parents would be scheduled at least.",

If your threatening my life of my family's life then you get a bullet. It beats waiting for the cops while you kill my family. \n\nWe have a right to bear arms to stop a tyrannical government, and honestly looking at the state of America now it seems things would be a lot worse if the population was unarmed. Mind you the American government has run vile experiments on its own people, segregated and beat its own people, cops kill alot (don't know the number, but do know it's unacceptable) of people a year. \n\nSo in conclusion I will hold on to my boomstick and you can enjoy your very safe existence that I whole heatedly envy .",

At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.\n> \n> They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).\n> \n> We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.\n> \n> We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).\n> \n> We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.\n> \n> We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their \"guns\". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt \"Creepers\" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.\n> \n> When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says \"sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go\" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.\n> \n> They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or \"do weird things\" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him \"where is this picture taken\" or \"who was there\" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.\n> \n> The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us \"the issue is closed\" and hangup. What the hell do we do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.2836 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Expect parents and students to react irrationally.  This is a reminder to parents to speak with kids about not discussing violent game play in school.  Good luck! \n\nPs. I'm sad that so many ppl disagree with me.  I would love to know what I said which brought such scorn.  This is how a situation like this should have been handled.  Its upsetting, and I get that, but this is post Columbine,and every week another school is getting blasted by students.
