Also 50% rubbing alcohol with seal not removed but pin punctured 3-4 times makes a great spray to dry out water and kill mold also.  God Bless and Good Recovery to All affected.

Not your attorney. \n\nBased on what you said, you\u2019re probably an employee, not an independent contractor. Here\u2019s what\u2019s important - Florida\u2019s workers comp statute prohibits you from making a bodily injury claim outside of the workers comp system UNLESS your employer fails to carry comp or fails to cover a covered injury. \n\nThat being said, you need to do 3 things:\n\n1. Talk to the hospital, explain that it was a work injury but that your company is refusing to cover. Ask for a payment extension of at least 90 days and get it in writing. This shouldn\u2019t be a problem. DO NOT forget that you will likely receive separate bills for the hospital, the physicians, radiology (if applicable), and possibly others. You have to do this step for each bill. This will hopefully protect your credit while you handle steps 2 and 3. \n\n2. Gather all evidence you can that you were an employee. If you found the job online, go download, print the posting. If you have a friend who hooked you up, get their name, address, and phone number. Get a copy of your cancelled paycheck. You\u2019ll want all this for your attorney so get on this ASAP. \n\n3. Find a personal injury attorney WHO ALSO ADVERTISES THAT THEY PRACTICE WORKERS COMP. Most do, but some don\u2019t, and you\u2019ll want one that can attack this employer in both directions, and knows what pitfalls to avoid - I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen a shitty personal injury attorney tell their client to skip the workers comp system, just file a bodily injury lawsuit, and then once they lose that suit realize they waived any comp recovery in doing so. An attorney who knows both systems will be invaluable here. \n\nHere in Florida, you should be able to find a personal injury attorney by going outside and looking in essentially any direction. Buses, billboards, etc. Contact 2 or 3 and see which office you feel most comfortable with. How a personal injury attorney handles intakes is often a sign of how they handle clients. You want personal, professional, and prompt but not pushy. ",

No way in hell id ever be able to pay off any medical debt, i long ago just came to terms with ill be living with that till i die, didnt realize it went off your credit report after 7 years as now i dont have any showing on my report anymore but it used to be in the negative many millions of dollars because i had a heart attack and that alone was a crazy ass bill that could have bought me a mansion and some of the finest luxury vehicles and yachts if i had the money to pay that one off.

If she was paying you by check, presumably without withholding for taxes, she may be categorizing you as a 1099 independent contractor as opposed to an employee.  This is further suggested by the fact you never signed a W9.  If this is the case, then as a 1099 independent contractor, she is not required to carry worker's compensation insurance on you, and is not liable for any medical bills.  Just to make this all the more fun, your own health insurance company may decide that since this is an on the job accident, they are not responsible for it either, and that you should have carried worker's comp on your 1099 \"business\".  Although this particular but would be dictated by the terms of your contract with your health insurance company.\n\nAdding another level of complexity to this...   Depending on the work you were doing, she may have improperly classified you as a 1099 subcontractor when you SHOULD have been an employee.  The authorities on the labor board or what have you in your state may be interested in this, and you may have a cause of action against your employer.\n\nIf she's paying you in cash via personal check, there's also a possibility that her own books aren't being handled in a way that's consistent with the law.  But this matter wouldn't impact liability one way or the other regarding your medical claim.\n\nHope this helps.",

You want to talk to the nice people in the state department that handles worker comp claims for people whose employers were stupid and did not have workers comp. Here will be such a department. They have almost certainly have  a fund for people whose employers were stupid and did not have workers comp coverage. If you meet the criteria for an hourly employee, irrespective of any w9, legally she has to have worker comp for you. (Hell, I own a small business and I have to have worker's comp for MYSELF.) \n\nOnce they're done with your boss, she will realize she was being very stupid. You may also no longer have a job , either because she fired you (likely) or because the company no longer exists once the industrial commission is done with them (also likely) but it sounds like, at this point, you may not have a job much longer anyway. And, in any event, do you really want to work for a company that is employing you in a dangerous industry and cannot/will not provide worker's comp coverage? The next time, it could be a life-altering injury. Do you really want to try to pay for major orthopedic surgery, rehab from a head injury, or any of the other entirely-possible injuries that can happen in landscaping? All it takes is one tree limb hitting you, or equipment failure, or just a trip and fall in the wrong spot, and you've got huge bills. \n\nYour state's industrial commission may be able to cover the bill, depending on how everything shakes out, and how convincingly your boss lies. \n\nSource: Used to work in a hospital. Used to speak to the nice people at the industrial commission occasionally, when figuring out where claims needed to go and/or getting auth for follow up care. The employees there seemed to take it quite personally when employers were dumb and did not have workers comp and people got hurt. ",

                "body":"A W9 is a Request for Taxpayer Identification Number. I believe she meant a W4 which is an employee notification to employer of claimed withholding exemptions. If an employee does not file a W4, the only legal effect is that tax must be withheld at the maximum rate (single, no dependents/exemptions). IRS Publication 15 directs employers to collect W4 forms before work starts, not sure if there is a penalty to the employer for not doing so (they do have to accept one if you give it to them for sure).\n\nWhether or not you are an employee is determined by [IRS rules](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee). I suspect that you are, but you can see for yourself at the link; assuming you are: You should report this matter to the IRS (actually, you will be required to do so later if they don't send you a W2). If you still are not issued one, you MUST file [Form 4852](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/missing-form-w-2-irs-can-help). If you are told you are an IC/sent a 1099, and you believe you are an employee, you can file an SS-8 with the IRS. Since you're being paid under the table, you probably won't get anything at all, so you'll just need to report that to the IRS. **Go ahead and set aside money to pay taxes (you might use the W4 withholding rules as a guide, because your employer's failure to pay taxes and to withhold your taxes does not change your total tax liability effective April 15 with the filing of your 1040.**\n\nIt looks like under [FL law](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/440.11), you can file a claim under normal personal injury laws against the employer OR under the rules that would have been applicable to your insurance claim. You should retain a workplace injury attorney to help you with this. Many work on contingency so you need not pay upfront; be sure to speak with several, ask about rates, and don't be swayed by who has the most billboards or late night commercials.",

                "body":"I work in a work comp law office, though not in Florida, so I'm not familiar with the law there.  The best thing to do is to consult a work comp attorney ASAP.  They will usually give you a free consultation.  In my state, it doesn't matter if the employer doesn't have work comp insurance or if you haven't signed a W9. As long as the employer can't prove you're a contractor, the employer is on the hook for your medical bills, lost wages, and any permanent impairment, along with possible fines from the state for not having work comp insurance.  That's great that you were paid by check because there's a paper trail, and it will be a lot easier to prove that you were an employee than if you were paid in cash. Worst case scenario, the employer declares bankruptcy and you don't collect anything, which sounds unlikely as it was a fairly minor injury.  Unfortunately, there's probably not very much money in the case, so you will have a hard time finding an attorney that will take your claim. You can probably litigate it yourself, however, which will probably take a long time, and in the meantime the ER is going to want to get paid.  If the hospital bills you saying they've tried to get the employer to pay and the employer denied the the claim, you should probably go ahead and get your insurance to pay for it or, if you don't have insurance, ask the hospital if they can give you a cash discount or set up a payment plan.  This will help keep your credit from getting dinged.  Again, not sure if all this is true in Florida work comp situations or not.",

Johnson federal courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama. I had to attend a safety orientation, and sign safety documents for every one of those jobs. Hard hats, steel toed boots, eye and fall protection, lock out procedures were discussed and documented in detail, but not a mention of gloves anywhere amongst them. I didn't see any illegal immigrants on any of those projects, or any of the many others I have worked on in my career. Another thing I never saw on any of those projects was a safety man/women issue a work stoppage over a worker not wearing gloves. That is because gloves are optional PPE. \n",

I think most decent companies would. OSHA doesn't have any rules requiring gloves, but digging is hard work (and I still remember what it is like) so making an employee comfortable while doing it is the least I can do, besides paying them well.\nMy first real job was with a large mechanical contractor. They contracted commercial plumbing and HVAC work. I spent time in both sides of the business. If I was with one of the plumbing crews and digging was the days work, gloves were given free of charge. If the days work was in the companies sheet metal shop, you were not allowed to even have gloves in your possession. Their reasoning was that gloves made handling sheet metal more dangerous. I am inclined to agree. With bare hands you can feel a sheet of metal start to slide in your grasp, and let go. With gloves you can't, and once it starts sliding you may not notice until it has already sliced through the glove, and your hand.\nThe only time I use gloves is if I have to grab something really nasty. The only exception being for handling caustic chemicals, which doesn't come up often.",

I'm not excusing the company for not taking care of the medical bill. They should, and they will if he follows through correctly. This notion that employees are somehow contract labor, while all the while working under the direct supervision of a company at an hourly rate is B.S. Going to work for any company before a full discussion about pay, benefits, taxes is a mistake, and I can't see how anyone could be unaware of that. If a company hires you, and you go to work knowing full well that the employer isn't going to tax your pay, and you don't take steps to make certain you fill out the correct forms so you can take care of that responsibility yourself, then employer, and employee are in the wrong. I know my states labor board has a section detailing what constitutes contract labor, and being a direct employee of a business. OP should have a look at his states labor board site, and he should be prepared to pay his share of taxes on any money he has received from this employer should he choose to move forward. Personally, I would take the medical bill to the employer, explain what steps I intend to take should they choose not to pay it, and if they pay it (if they are concerned about money this is the cheapest out for them), then look for a legitimate job.

By classifying you the wrong way, she doesn't pay the employer side of FICA.  \n\nSecondly, she is not paying into your state's unemployment program or covering you with a temporary disability plan.  Depending on local law, these are both usually required for regular employees.  If you work enough hours each week, there may be other required benefits too.\n\nThen there's workers comp.  Even *if* you are correctly designated as a contractor for tax purposes, WC definitions are not exactly the same and it's possible that you'd still fall under WC guidelines as someone that ought to be covered.  Without a WC plan in place, it's also less likely that she has any concept of workplace safety.  Why weren't you required to wear gloves for eg?\n\nMy point here is that your employer has likely broken many many labor laws, not just regarding WC.  Please don't let her bully you into giving up on anything you are due.  Get a lawyer and contact the labor board, like everyone else is saying. \ud83d\ude00",

I think you should consider talking privately to her about paying the medical bills before you do anything. Tell her you will keep it confidential, you just can\u2019t afford the money or time to pay those bills *or get caught up in any legal battle*. \n\nThis is what working *under the table* means. You have zero protection. You don\u2019t pay taxes, she doesn\u2019t pay taxes on your behalf. No contribution to your Social Security, no insurance that would fully pay your medical bills & pay you for missed days of work from the injury. Employers pay workers\u2019 insurance based on their total payroll. She\u2019s probably not showing *any* payroll for most of her employees. When you agreed to work under the table, you agreed that you\u2019re both engaging in illegal behavior. \n\nIt sounds like this was the verbal agreement from the start. She can still try to cover herself by issuing you a 1099 at the end of the year, though I doubt you could be classified as an independent contractor. Look up the FL requirements to be one before you talk to her so you can shut that argument down immediately.\n\n",

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

They do that because they don't want you, in effect, bypassing their tenant screening procedures by moving in an off-lease third party. In my experience, this is one of those clauses that only gets enforced, in practice, when a roommate or neighbor complains to the landlord, because otherwise how would they find out? I'm wondering if this is (perceived to be?) a widespread issue at your complex and this is management's effort to get a handle on the issue.\n\nAs for the bit about ID checks and security patrols and police check-ups...this part is making my Fair Housing bone tingle.  Does there happen to be a high immigrant population in your complex? Here in Florida, (legal and illegal) immigrants often live \"off the grid,\" meaning they are often the unscreened third party tenant who gets moved into places without the landlord's approval.  Unknown/unapproved tenants and over-occupancy of units are a legit problem for landlords, but enforcement of rules cannot be carried out selectively based on national origin or immigration status.  If you suspect the driver for this new rule is based on illegal discrimination, start [here](https://www.mass.gov/fair-housing-law) to read more about what constitutes illegal discrimination and how to report it if you choose to do so.",

She has decided to dig a trench along our property line and fill it with salt.  We asked her not to proceed with this plan and instead we would work to install a physical root barrier along the property line.  Last night I discovered she has moved forward with her plan to burry salt.  \n> \n> We are concerned that this is going to injure / kill / damage our tree and landscaping.  I don't even know where to start with solving this problem.  Honestly who salts the earth???  Looking for advice on ways to solve this.

                "body":"First and foremost, the law most people would want to cite is California Penal Code Section 647.\n\n>(j) (1) A person who looks through a hole or opening, into, or otherwise views, by means of any instrumentality, including, but not limited to, a periscope, telescope, binoculars, camera, motion picture camera, camcorder, or mobile phone, the interior of a bedroom, bathroom, changing room, fitting room, dressing room, or tanning booth, or the interior of any other area in which the occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy, with the intent to invade the privacy of a person or persons inside. This subdivision does not apply to those areas of a private business used to count currency or other negotiable instruments.\n\nTo give full discussion about the legalities of this specific case, I'll cite some previous examples (state dependent): \n\n>\u201cCameras exist for security purposes of our students. There are no privacy violations because the water closets are from floor to ceilings. There are no cameras in the water closets. They are solely in the washrooms for the security purposes of our students. We have conferred with legal counsel, prior to the installation of the cameras. Law enforcement did a thorough walkthrough. They have assured us that there are not privacy issues. Both counsel and law enforcement agree that is for this addresses safety of our students.\u201d\n\nhttps://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/11/03/school-security-cameras-bathrooms/\n\nBrannum v. Overton County School:\n\n> A search--and there can be no dispute that videotaping students in a school locker\n> room is a search under the Fourth Amendment -- is permissible in its scope when\n> the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and \n> not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature\n> of the infraction. It is a matter of balancing the scope and the manner in which the\n> search is conducted in light of the students' reasonable expectations of privacy,\n> the nature of the intrusion, and the severity of the school officials' need in\n> enacting such policies, including particularly, any history of injurious behavior\n> that could reasonably suggest the need for the challenged intrusion.\n\n>Applying this reasoning to the facts of the case, the court found no evidence in the record\nindicating \"any concerns about student safety or security in the locker rooms that would\nreasonably justify the installation of the cameras to record all the activities there.\" \n\nSource: http://cehdclass.gmu.edu/jkozlows/lawarts/01JAN09.pdf\n\nLong story short: It can be a battle. People here are telling you to call the cops, and I'm going to guess the cops are going to talk to the on campus LEO who's going to be state that \"oh yeah, don't worry their not pointing at the toilets\" and that'll be the end of it. No harm for a first step, but I have my doubts anything is going to happen from LEOs. \n\nThe definition of 'expectation of privacy' is another issue. Shared areas generally do not have it, as the definition in relation to video surveillance, which varies from state to state, is a place where one can expect to undress without intrusion. Calfornia law specifically forbids recording in these areas with the specifications: \"**without the consent or knowledge of that other person, with the intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person and invade the privacy of that other person, under circumstances in which the other person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.**\" A good California example of this would be the Dani Mathers case, where she pleaded guilty of intrusion of privacy. \n\nThe issue that will be argued, if this subject gets to court, is that with the use of signs that warn the 'public' areas of the bathroom are being recorded with non-concealed cameras, that the person has knowledge and the school has consent to record. An argument would be it would consist of no more of a violation of privacy than having a teacher posted in each bathroom for security purposes during breaks, which I don't believe could be perceived as illegal from a penal code privacy sense. The legal smart thing to do is for the school to remove the cameras, especially with the potential backlash.\n\nThe strongest case though, as a public school, is your fourth amendment rights, as demonstrated Brannum v. Overton County School. The precedent should make this a moderately open and shut case, so long as there isn't a history that students were being harmed in the bathrooms.",

What did he tell them happened to the trailer and what actually happened to it? So, yes, there might be some insurance fraud here on top of the forgery. All of this ought to be reported to the police (subject to the advice of his attorney). For the former, reporting directly to the insurance company is also a good idea. They are more likely to be successful in convincing authorities to act than you are.\n\nGetting bled slowly by bad faith litigation is unfortunately not unusual. It sounds like he is already on a payment plan with his attorney. He could ask them to modify the terms or to ask the court to hold the other party accountable for repeatedly skipping hearings. I would not hold my breath on either. Criminal charges and insurance clawing back the money for renovations may make the other party more or less cooperative. I would lean toward less, but it is difficult to say with any confidence. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to your father. ",

Who is the executor of the estate by the way? S? If not, then the will needs to be probated and an executor named.  If this has already been done, and it is S, then you could argue he abused this authority by authorizing himself to do the non-repair renovations on the trailer. I\u2019m surprised your father\u2019s attorney hasn\u2019t brought this up with him. You would need to litigate all that though, and none of it really helps the cost issue.\n\nThe answer on your last question is not really, no. If he feels his attorney is not proving their value (and $2000 monthly could be overkill depending on what is actually being done), he can seek to find another attorney who will work for less. He could also talk to the attorney he currently has about how to keep costs down. He will be billed, though, for that conversation.",

This also has an interesting backstory.\n\nDuring the last year of his life, my grandfather was losing his memory. There was a woman in his life whose name I\u2019m not sure of (she was from Russia and used an Americanized version of her Russian name, but let\u2019s call her Karen because). She was a friend of my grandmother\u2019s before she passed and Karen and my grandfather moved in together about two years before he passed. She was retched! She took advantage of my grandfather\u2019s memory issues to take his Social Security checks. She\u2019d take him to the bank and have him sign them and give the teller permission to cash them or transfer the money into her account.\n\nNow, this is all assumption. My dad helped my grandfather manage his accounts after Karen moved out. (When my grandfather\u2019s memory got to the point where he needed more constant care, she fled.) He\u2019d make sure my grandfather had checks out for taxes, bills, groceries, etc. He didn\u2019t technically have legal access, but my grandfather wouldn\u2019t have objected to it. My dad says that there was upwards of $15,000 in my grandfather\u2019s savings accounts. My cousin, who also helped my grandfather, agrees that she saw these amounts too but doesn\u2019t want to get in the middle of things (she\u2019s S\u2019s daughter). \n\nCash withdrawals made this money disappear, but dad wasn\u2019t able to pinpoint when until he received bank info more recently. S claims that Karen still came around on days my grandfather received his social security checks. She apparently stole from his house too, as we noticed a lot of belongings would disappear. They could have been taken by Karen but we don\u2019t really have any way of finding out.  ",

The family friends told me I couldn't keep my dog in their home anymore and that I needed to get rid of him, I didn't want to do that so I had posted on my Snapchat if someone would be willing to take my dog in until I could get into a stable home. A boy I knew offered to take my dog in and whenever I was ready I could take him back. Fast forward to today and I've recently moved into my grandmothers and when I asked the boy if I could have my dog back he refused. I've asked multiple times, I've run out of options. What should I do now? That's my baby and I really want him back but I can't just go into their home and take him, should I call the cops? If I do how will they help? Will they even do anything if they think im wasting their time? If anyone has any advice please tell me. I miss my dog so much and its breaking my heart the longer were apart. I just want him to come home to me. I have proof he was my dog such as his medical records and his name was under my grandmothers name in the vets system. As well as multiple pictures of him as a baby. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

                "body":"Don't worry about the recording. It's not legal in Florida unless you have the consent it both parties. Focus instead on the way this eviction was conducted.\n\nThe only person who can legally evict you is a judge. If your landlord tried to get you to leave, lock you out, or disturb your belongings, he's committing a crime.\n\nThe only way your landlord could legally get you to leave is for him to file against you in court, pay the fee to the court, the court would schedule a hearing, you as the tenant would be given written notice of the hearing, and it would be posted publicly on your door.\n\nAt the hearing, you would have the opportunity to explain your side of things to the judge. At worst, the judge would likely give you at least 30 days to remain until you had to move out.\n\nAfter that, if the judge orders you evicted (by signing a written order on a piece of paper), the only way you can be removed from the residence legally is if the landlord takes the judge's written order (called a \"Writ of Possession\") to the sheriff, pays the sheriff a fee, and then the sheriff physically removes you from the residence. Once that happens, if you try to go back inside, you're trespassing.\n\nBut before the moment the sheriff knocks on your door to remove you, no one can mess with you or your stuff.\n\nSo, was there a hearing? Did you attend? Did the judge sign a Writ of Possession (order evicting you)? Did a sheriff come to your door with the Writ of Possession and physically remove you from the residence?\n\nIf the answer is no, then the landlord conducted an illegal self-help eviction (Google it). The landlord can get in huge trouble for that. If that's the case, write a emergency letter to the judge explaining you were illegally evicted, ask for an emergency hearing, and you should get a lawyer ASAP.",

The most important thing to see is if a Writ of Possession was signed by the judge.\n\nIf the sheriff came when you weren't there, it's possible a Writ of Possession was signed and then executed by the sheriff while you weren't home. If that happened, it was perfectly legal for them to remove all your stuff, because you never went to the hearing, and never explained your side of things to the judge.

Many lawyers work on contingency (a no-money down system) or on payment plans then you can absolutely pursue this on your own.

Don't mince any words - they are charging you as a drug dealer. They love to send drug dealers to prison.\n\nYou need an attorney. Pronto. As in after you read my comment grab everything related to the case they gave you and head out. Your count appointed lawyer is not good enough. They sometimes don't care. Or are overworked. Or just aren't respected in the same way a private lawyer is. They sometimes make deals behind your back with the DAs to get convictions. Yes its fucked. Nothing we can do about it.\n\nDo you have any money? An attorney will be expensive but if you have 1,000 plus you might be able to get some sort of payment plan and get them retained. If you don't have the money contact anyone you can and raise the money. You desperately need a criminal defense lawyer. If you go in without one tomorrow they are going to fuck you like you have never been fucked before. You can walk right into a firm - no need for even an appointment really. They deal with emergency situations like this all the time. It is their job.\n\nYou shouldn't have spoken to the police at all (did you? unclear if it was talking to friend)- but I understand it is easy to do so under pressure. I would also recommend leaving the house if you can - that roomate is no longer your friend as he dragged you into his own drug situation from the way you told the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry I didn't pull any punches here but you need to hear the truth, no one else is being straight up with you here.",

Recently the registers have been short 50-70 dollars for the past week or so. Since we cant find out who is doing it my manager said they'll have to take money out of all of the managers checks to make up for the money that was short. Im pretty sure that is illegal, but i want to make sure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

Most of the leases I\u2019ve signed, and my current one actually, state that we can\u2019t change or add locks without notifying the landlord and giving them a copy of the key. I assume this could also extend to barricades that would prevent entry. Actually, now that I think about it, I believe my current lease even specifically prohibits us from doing things like nailing windows shut. Again, different lease in a different state, but my thought is that OP should use caution if they\u2019re considering doing this. Even when notice is required, landlords still generally need to be able to access the property to make repairs or in the event of an emergency. ",

I\u2019m not sure on the laws in your particular area but I think you can move out before your lease it up (no contract can force you to stay somewhere) and risk losing the deposit. Is your deposit in a protection scheme? If it is (and legally has to be) then you can deal directly with the protection scheme company about getting it back on the grounds on harassment. They are impartial and I\u2019m certain they would understand why you had to terminate the contract early. \n\nI never comment on this subreddit because i can\u2019t offer legal advice, but I needed to comment to say this - OP his behaviour is really alarming. From what you described you should be really concerned for your safety. You defo need to install those cameras, check for hidden cameras in your apartment, and start keeping written record of everything that\u2019s happened and happens in the future. Times, dates, exact details. \n\nIf his behaviour escalates in any way you need to get out straight away and stay with a family member/friend. Don\u2019t second guess yourself if you feel uneasy/unsafe, just leave. \nAlso, if possible could you ask a friend to stay with you for the next few weeks (I know this isn\u2019t always possible) because it honestly doesn\u2019t seem safe for you to be alone with this guy.

                "body":"In Pennsylvania, landlords may enter with reasonable notice to perform repairs, inspections, and so on. Reasonable includes knocking before they enter. In an emergency, they may just enter, but they should still knock first. And of course, you are not talking about an emergency, you are talking about in inappropriate landlord. There is no specific statute, but you will find that this has been established in case law. Of course, you also need to look at your lease. \n\nIt is a bit unclear to me how this common area is laid out. You write that the kitchen is yours, but you have to walk through a common area to get into it. If the kitchen is otherwise blocked off, meaning that you have to walk through a common area, but the kitchen is not a common area, the landlord ought not be entering it, barring the reasonable notice and purposes I mentioned.\n\nIt could be that you have an awkward landlord that perhaps has been friendly with tenants in the past. If you are otherwise happy, the best thing might be to draw boundaries with him.\n\nYou might also want to show him the laws in Pennsylvania about the right to quiet enjoyment.\n\nHopefully, I am not breaking any rules by linking to this nonprofit website that has a very good Know Your Rights brocuhre, including a section on your right to quiet enjoyment and the landlord's right to enter with reasonable notice. [http://www.equalhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Know-Your-Rights-as-a-Renter-in-PA-digital-copy.pdf](http://www.equalhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Know-Your-Rights-as-a-Renter-in-PA-digital-copy.pdf)\n\nI am quoting the portion it contains on a tentant's right to privacy:\n\n>Tenants\u2019 Right to Privacy Pennsylvania Law states that in every lease (whether written or verbal), there is a promise that the landlord will not unreasonably interfere with your right to possess the leased premises. This Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, also includes the right to privacy. The rent paid not only gives you as a tenant a roof over your head, but also ensures the right to enjoy the premises without reasonable and excessive intrusions by the landlord. Landlords only have the right to reasonable access to the leased premises. If the landlord enters your rental unit for no reason or disturbs you at night, he or she may be breaching the lease. The landlord does have the right to enter rental premises occasionally for reasonable purpose including inspection and maintenance, repairs, or to show the property to potential buyers or renters. Reasonable also means that the landlord should come at a reasonable time, give you advance notice first, and should knock first\u2014unless there is an emergency. If there is an emergency such as broken water pipes or smoke detectors activated, then the landlord has the right to enter immediately without prior notice. If the lease states that the landlord may enter without notice during reasonable hours, the tenant may have no right to require advance notice. However, if the landlord or the landlord\u2019s employees repeatedly enter without notice, send the landlord a letter requesting a minimum of 24 hours advance notice prior to entry in a non-emergency situation. Keep a copy of the letter and send the original by certified mail, \u201creturn receipt requested\u201d. Although the landlord is not obligated to comply with your request for the advance notice, common courtesy would encourage the landlord to give the tenant notice prior to entering the rental unit. If the landlord does not adhere to the general standards as outlined above and repeatedly enters the rental unit without notice, the landlord may be cited for trespassing. Call the local police department for more information.\n\nI agree with the folks who have suggested cameras. Set up a few in your private areas, have them upload to the cloud. Just seeing them may discourage him from bad behavior.\n\nHopefully, you just have a landlord who will listen to reason once you explain the laws to him. I wish you the best.\n\n&#x200B;",

A lease, in very simplified terms,  essentially grants you the ***right*** to use a location.  This does not mean that you ***have*** to stay there.  You could relocate and leave the unit empty while you sort this out.  Until finalized you are responsible for all associated cost as if you still lived there, but will not have to deal with the landlord as you have described.  \n\n  \nJust so that there is no confusion, I am in no way suggesting that you abandon the lease.  Not using what you are paying for is very different than walking away from the lease.  \n\n\nObviously, money will be a huge factor when considering this route.  You could potentially have to pay the full 1 year lease at the original place and a new place.  If it gets bad enough that you are getting too stressed over the situation, it's always there as an option that's on the table.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you are able to find a solution that works for you.\n\nBest of luck\n\n&#x200B;",

Not planning to take legal action here yet but I lurk on this Reddit sometimes and I am definitely curious about something!\n> \n> I just moved into a great new apartment last month. It\u2019s a house where the downstairs is my own apartment and the upstairs is the landlord\u2019s apartment. One important thing to know is that my kitchen is detached from my other rooms. I have to go through a common hallway to reach my kitchen, but it is MY kitchen. Only problem with the place  is that the landlord has been doing some weird stuff that makes me uncomfortable. \n> \n> I was going to try to skip over the socially weird stuff that he does and keep it to the stuff that I think could be illegal. But he\u2019s very creepy. He comes down and knocks on my door often, just to be like \u201cWhat are you doing today?\u201d This has happened once or twice a week the past few weeks. Once he even called me. He was like \u201cI\u2019m going to a party with some other property owners in the neighborhood, wanted to know if you would like to come too...\u201d which isn\u2019t that bad, but when I said no he started pressing me. He got kind of mad, started being like \u201cyou know this is really disappointing to me, I thought maybe you\u2019d want to support your new neighborhood etc\u201d I ended up hanging up on him. I don\u2019t want to be friends with my landlord. I hate the dynamic and he\u2019s also probably the same age as my grandparents. \n> \n> My apartment has three doors basically. But two of them are nailed shut and can\u2019t be used. It\u2019s an old house that was converted to be this way. Last week he came down and knocked on the main door. I didn\u2019t want to talk so I didn\u2019t answer. So then...he goes down and knocks on the second and third doors really hard, knowing those can\u2019t be used. I stayed quiet and just didn\u2019t answer. Five minutes later I get an email. \u201cJust knocked on your door to see what you\u2019re up to. Thought I heard you down there but I guess not.\u201d Which once again, probably not illegal but really weird and really makes me not like him. He also tries to get me to help him with things in his apartment. Like moving things around etc. I won\u2019t do it. Not that I\u2019m opposed to helping someone but he just makes me so uncomfortable that I don\u2019t feel good going up to his place. He asks several times a week if I can help him with a \u201cfavor\u201d or \u201cchore\u201d upstairs. Haven\u2019t said yes yet. \n> \n> So that gives an idea of what he\u2019s like. He is really bad at personal space. And so far it\u2019s rubbing me the wrong way. But last week he really did something that I feel is illegal. I was having some friends over for dinner in my kitchen. While we were eating he came down and just barged into my kitchen. He stood really close to one of my friends and was like \u201cI heard you having a party down here and wanted to introduce myself to your friends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met them before.\u201d And then he did so. All of us were pretty freaked out. We were all sitting at the table and he was standing over us, right over the table, rocking back and forth. Just kind of making small talk. Trying to get to know my friends. He has come to my kitchen doorway before to say hello while he\u2019s walking through the hallway but has never come into my kitchen. I eventually got him to leave by just saying \u201cAlright, bye\u201drepeatedly and then I stood up and showed him to the door. My friends left immediately afterwards. One of them was kind of upset and just freaked out about the way he was being. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was so mad. The next day I sent him an email, so that it could be documented in writing. I said basically, what you did last night is not okay. You are never allowed in my apartment without permission. I pay you rent for my place, you respect my privacy, Etc. Made it clear that it pissed me off and I wasn\u2019t okay with it. He tried to make me feel bad in his response and didn\u2019t really apologize. He was like \u201cwell I heard there was company in my house and I wanted to introduce myself. I was just trying to be nice and social\u201d or something like that. Tried to make it seem like he\u2019s this innocent lonely old man. Doesn\u2019t seem to think that what he did was wrong! I don\u2019t buy it. Keep in mind that he\u2019s been a landlord for a long time and has had many tenants and has to know how this stuff works. He\u2019s a creep. \n> \n> So what I\u2019m wondering is...if he does something like this again is there legal action I can take? Do landlords have to give a notice before coming into your apartment? I thought that was a thing. The reason I\u2019m worried/wondering is because I haven\u2019t lived here but a few weeks and he\u2019s already pushed these personal boundaries very aggressively. If he continues down this path of invading my privacy, there\u2019s got to be something I can do, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

I can probably manage with my bike for some time.\n\nSometimes when fault is very clearly the other drivers fault, your insurance will cover it and send it along with the bill to the other company. Otherwise, the other driver's insurance can pay/reimburse for reasonable rental fees.          \n            \n> Also, do I have to pay my deductible (its $1500) if its not my fault? Or does her insurance pay it?\n\nAsk your insurance about that. Because the fault is very clearly the other driver, some insurance providers won't charge you for it because they will get the deductible back along with the rest of the money from the other driver's insurance company.

They were drinking all day and getting in to fights. I called the landlord to complain about the noise. He took care of it and they dispersed for sometime. They came back again and continued drinking and fighting. \n> \n> The girl got into her car to go buy cigarettes. She came back and drove through a fence, ran over her boyfriend, and crashed into my parked car. I was in bed when all this happened.\n> \n> My dad tells me I should get a lawyer and sue the driver, but I don't know what to do.

If, for some reason, you don\u2019t get your deductible back, then that would be something you could sue over in small claims court. If you have to rent a car, you should get reimbursed for that either under your own policy, if you have rental reimbursement, or the driver\u2019s insurance company. If your insurance company pays, it will go after the driver\u2019s insurance company for the funds. If you do not get reimbursed, again, that would be something you could sue over in small claims court.\n\nMany people look to sue when they have property damage, but if the other person\u2019s insurance handles everything then you would have no basis to sue and it would be inappropriate to do so.

Your boss has seriously overstepped, and has disregarded fairly blunt requests that he stop discussing his sex life with you: he's now into territory that (edit: in a larger company, at least - thanks, u/ops-name-checks-out!) exposes the company to an EEOC complaint or a lawsuit.\n\nYour boyfriend's actions have likely complicated the situation, but as you never directed him to blackmail your boss for you, that's his problem. Your problem is whether you are willing to tolerate him exceeding your boundaries like this, which is more of a relationship issue than a legal one.\n\n^(Secretary is great, but Secretary's more vocal fans are the absolute _worst_.)",

The best thing for him to do right now is some soul-searching about why he thought that that was appropriate: anything further he says to your boss or to law enforcement will only make this worse.\n\nThe ideal outcome is that you, your boss, and your boyfriend all forget this episode happened. Pursue your final paycheck as normal if it isn't forthcoming, through your jurisdiction's wage claim process at your previous rate, and don't mention your boyfriend's involvement.

There's no good reason for that, and it's the key element of what turned a fairly normal demand that you be paid for your time into extortionate behaviour.\n\nI'm skeptical the police will look into it, but he should absolutely not double down, try to explain himself, or otherwise continue to engage with your boss or with anyone else over this. It would be mildly inappropriate had he stuck to the demand (it's not his business whether your boss pays you properly or not; it's yours), but by blackmailing your boss, he stepped way over into _very_ inappropriate, and illegal activity, and he should hope that everyone else is willing to treat it as an impassioned but poor decision.\n\nBy dropping the issue and continuing your exit, you've done the best thing to protect yourself from your boyfriend's poor decisions.\n\nTo be clear, I understand that your boyfriend thought he was protecting you.

I work in an extremely niche \"industry\" getting LTLs(Little tiny loads) onto trucks with spare room and time heading in the same direction that the LTL needs to go. I am 24F and my boss is 56M.\n> \n> I started working here two months ago because the pay was very decent with little to no experience needed ($14/h and 55 hours a week). I did 2 interviews then started. It all was pretty good, it's kind of slow work with a decent amount of downtime but it pays so well and I get paid about 1/3 of the time to be surfing the net or playing games on my switch so I can't really complain. It's pretty much just me and the boss all day and until recently he just sat in his office by himself watching Netflix/Amazon in the downtime and we didn't speak much besides work when we had to.\n> \n> That all changed a week ago when he started talking and talking and talking throughout the entire day, it didn't really bother me and I figured it just took him a while to get comfortable with me. I learned about his life, family and he learned a bit about mine but he kept steering it towards my boyfriend, sex life, and really focuses on fetishes. I told him several times that's not appropriate and he dropped it for at least an hour before brining it up again focusing pretty heavily on BDSM. I'm not a stranger to kinks but I'm not going down that road discussing it with my boss, whom I spend almost 60 hours a week with entirely alone with the rare in office visitors (a person comes by maybe once a week for 15-30 minutes).\n> \n> It got to the point 3 days ago I finally told my boyfriend and I was trying to not tell him because he would of course be upset and probably want to speak to my boss. He's not the super jealous type or the macho man go hit him type but with how far my boss was taking it he probably would. The day I finally told my boyfriend what my boss was doing is when I left work early because my boss sat me down with his laptop and starting playing the movie \"The Secretary\", I've seen this movie before and if you haven't it's a BDSM movie where a boss makes his secretary his slave. (NSFW obviously, don't Google it if you can get in trouble). While he sat there expecting me to watch this movie he showed me his briefcase that had handcuffs, a crop, rope etc in it like he fully expected me to be his sexual slave after watching the movie. I noped out of there and called my boyfriend as I was leaving, he left work early also and then went to my work to pickup the things I left on my desk because I was not going back.\n> \n> My boyfriend assured me he wasn't going to hit him or do anything stupid except get my stuff and tell him I quit. Fast forward to today and I got an email from my boss telling me I have been given a raise, $24/h and I can work from home just putting the info from the emails into the Google doc spreadsheet like before.... Obviously I'm thinking wtf why did he just give me a 100% raise and I can work from home? I just had an interview scheduled through a friend for Monday.\n> \n> I talked to my boyfriend after he got home from work and asked him wth happened at my job when he went to get my stuff and quit for me. Turns out my boyfriend in his infinite wisdom told this old pervert if he didn't pay me a severance he was going to tell his wife what he tried to do... I wasn't expecting a severance because I barely worked there and just wanted my last check. I guess the old guy took it a bit further and doubled my pay and let me work from home to keep his crazy movie fantasy a secret??\n> \n> Where do I even begin here to fix all this crap? I don't want to work for this guy but I don't know the legalities of what my boyfriend may have inadvertently just did.\n> \n> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

I'm not an expert in child learning and language development, but I highly doubt this is for a reason relating to that. Consider it a blessing that you no longer work for a \"person\" who considers what you did horrible. This goes beyond just being overprotective. She can't do anything to you legally, and honestly at this point you could have her seriously damaged in the court of public opinion. \n\nJust imagine a terrified, confused, teenage girl going to this woman's place of work (hospital) and loudly pleading with her in front of others, \"please don't sue me because I taught your daughter the words fish and horse in Spanish while babysitting her! I'm only ____ years old, and I didn't know you you felt that way about us!\" Unless you live in select parts of the United States, the ramifications of this could prove to be quite the life lesson for her. I worked in a couple hospitals, and if I caught wind of a colleague/employee putting out this sort of vibe, I would immediately contact Administration/HR.\n\n",

Well since I\u2019m there late with her daughter I help her with her homework, heat up some dinner, put on a Netflix show for her/ let her watch YouTube afterward(if she\u2019s allowed to that day, it alternates). I usually do homework when she\u2019s off doing something by herself.\n> \n> Here comes the issue: The other day I was doing Spanish homework. The daughter was being a bit restless so I\u2019d figure I\u2019d have some fun and teach her a little Spanish. No harm done here right???? Wrong. I guess the daughter showed off her newfound ability to say caballo and peces to her mom. Her mom then proceeded to yell at me (not in front of the girl) yesterday for teaching her \u201cthese things\u201d.\n> She told me:\n> 1. I was fired \n> 2. She was going to tell my school that I \u201cdid this\u201d (?)\n> 3. And she\u2019ll see me soon in court (??) because she\u2019s going to sue me (????)\n> \n> Ok so, first things first, I haven\u2019t said anything to my parents yet because I think they still might be pissed about me popping a car tire earlier this week. But WTF did I do wrong here? Did she think I was trying to ruin her kid? \n> \n> I\u2019m most terrified about what she\u2019s going to tell the school. She could make something up and it could really screw me up for college. What can I possibly do in this situation? (I\u2019m 18 btw)\n> \n> And can she actually sue me? Doesn\u2019t she need a reason? Could she make something up and god forbid bankrupt my family in court?? This woman is both insane and wealthy. She used to pay me way above minimum wage and has a real nice house, so she must be making a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.125 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
