Yeah, technically OP would probably be in the right to keep using the image but it'll bankrupt any normal person to fight this. Better to get some quick cash from the big corp to cover the costs of  recall and then some to account for him abandoning the license. Then, if he wants, OP could always sue the original artist for return of whatever they paid for the license too. That could probably be done in small claims without an attorney. ",

Where OP would be seeking to recover the cost of the agreement and the costs associated with the product production.  You probably want to avoid the lawsuit with the big company.

It was brought to my attention that a much larger national brand has started using the image for one of their products. I contacted the artist, and yes- the bigger company paid to get exclusive rights, and I was not informed. I am now in the position of recalling my product. Is the artist in a legal grey area for doing this? Do I have any legal standing to get my money back from him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
