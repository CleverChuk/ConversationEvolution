He relies mainly on his phone for glucose monitoring. Yesterday the public school he attends took his phone. Their policy is that is you are \u201cUsing for your phone to much\u201d they take it. First time 1 day. Second time 3 days. Third time 5 days. (End of school week) In the past is has not been a problem because after school I have been able to get it. I am out of the country on business and my wife is out of state as well. My wife called the school and they say the will only give the phone back to a \u201cParent or Legal Guardian\u201d the school knows he has Diabetes. There is no documentation that he uses his phone for glucose. He offered to show the principal. Yesterday my son went to the drug store after school and got a finger pricker. He told me he would be \u201cFine\u201d. I know how much he hates using one and it is not as good as the continuous glucose monitor on his phone. What legal rights do I have to make the achool give him back his phone before Thursday when My wife gets home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",

As long as it says that he has to monitor his glucose intake (and it\u2019s vague about how he does it) you may be able to convince the principal to let him do it. If they refuse then maybe pursue legal action. Talk to the principal first though. See if you can come up with an agreement where he can check his glucose level in certain classes. You may want to ask your son how often he\u2019s really using his phone in class. If he\u2019s habitually using it his teachers may see it as an annoyance rather than your son actually using it to monitor something important. Usually teachers are understanding.

There are a few things you should know before you post here:\r\n\r\n**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.\r\n\r\n**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  \r\n\r\n**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. \r\n\r\n**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLocationBot 4.31977192 | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)",
