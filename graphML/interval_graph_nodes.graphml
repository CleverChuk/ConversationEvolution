Because of a history of child stars being exploited by their parents, California law makes clear that earnings by minors in the entertainment industry are the property of the minor, not their parents. Since a minor cannot legally control their own money, California Law governs their earnings and creates a fiduciary relationship between the parent and the child. California law also requires that 15% of all minors’ earnings must be set aside in a blocked trust account commonly known as a Coogan Account.

Also, the minor in California has a tutor assigned to them that are supposed to act as constant reps for them on set as well, and has quick access to SAG and the contract. As long as this person isn’t in your parent’s pocket, the tutor would be the first person I might turn to, to be lead in the correct direction.

Edit: IANAL but I’m a 2nd Assistant Director. I’m responding because your legal advice is the most direct and responsible comment out of everything here.

      <data key="d7">Seek out a lawyer who has experience with this. An entertainment lawyer or one who does estates and trusts will probably be a good bet. Go through SAG first if you can, they'll be able to hook you up with someone who does exactly this kind of thing. The lawyer will be happy to work for some of the money that you'll be getting back from your father so it's ok that you don't have any money now.

After you get the money back, you should look into emancipation. Then your parents will have no rights to any of your new accounts, records, property, etc. It shouldn't be that hard as long as you're making enough to support yourself. If you don't make a ton, getting a side gig for when you're not working would be a good idea too.

Finally, put some of your money in a trust that pays it out to your steadily over a long period of time, or that you can't touch for a long time. You have no idea if you'll still be acting at 26 and you might want to go to college or something. Also real estate in CA is nuts expensive, it's nice to be able to afford a house especially when you want kids and need the room, maybe around age 36. What I'm saying is 16 year olds don't have as many expensive needs as older people so saving the majority of your money (after your basic living expenses) is the smart move. Or at the very least, a trust that pays you out steadily will prevent you from going broke if you're between jobs for too long or have unexpected expenses.</data>

Your directors should have the number if you don't. They can help with your current income, and likely help you contact a lawyer for income from past projects.

Ask them about the Coogan Act. It's a California law specifically designed for this, since this is far from the first time it's happened. Your best bet here is being informed– your father, if he knows about this, is likely riding on the assumption that you *don't* and won't have the tools to fight back.

If your parents are smart, they won't bite the hand that will eventually feed them.

Sorry for the less than helpful advice. Best of luck.

Edit: I should say I agree with everyone else that you should talk to a lawyer and not take this lying down. If it turns out that its gonna be a nast legal battle and put your career at risk, THEN go with the flow.</data>
