For example they'd have to recode their encryption to accept the configured key or a secret master key.\n\nNow the DoD is pretty good with checking this stuff, and I suspect it's something that would get discussed/disclosed. The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. It may be a violation of Australian law to export it without the backdoor. If that's the case the DoD would just declare it not suitable for use and then everyone would have to ban it.",

I would argue that is less secure than putting it in my desk drawer even though both are unlocked. Bad actors knowing about the thing you wish to secure inherently makes it less secure.\n\nI use obscurity when I have to. Say I'm coming home from work with my laptop and have to pick something up at the store. I never just leave it on the seat, I stash it behind my seat and throw a blanket on it.

To be honest, that's not a particularly complex security protection, and one that could easily be reversed by anyone doing the level of hardware hacking that we saw on the PlayStation consoles.\n\nHardest part would be establishing what a \"good\" image looked like, which I'm sure [this guy](https://hackaday.com/2016/07/11/cracking-the-sega-saturn-after-20-years/) could do with his techniques.\n\nThe other thing to remember too is, tools and techniques were far less mature back then. We MD5d passwords, and used WEP for our wifi.

Otherwise it would be simple to work around the GDPR.\n\nIt is absolutely correct. The GDPR carves out a very large exception for *lawful* orders. To quote:\n\n>The second part of this exemption can apply if you are required by law, or court order, to disclose personal data to a third party. It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that complying with those provisions would prevent you disclosing the personal data.\n\nFrom: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/#ex3\n\nHere's an example, again from above:\n\n>An employer receives a court order to hand over the personnel file of one of its employees to an insurance company for the assessment of a claim. Normally, the employer would not be able to disclose this information because doing so would be incompatible with the original purposes for collecting the data (contravening the purpose limitation principle). However, on this occasion the employer is exempt from the purpose limitation principle\u2019s requirements because it would prevent the employer disclosing personal data that it must do by court order.",

Local police departments have no authority to ask for voluntary assistance. These voluntary assistance notices just protect the individuals and companies from civil liability if they choose to cooperate with the investigation, and are not mandatory.\n\nAs for the mandatory assistance notices, State police CANNOT give mandatory technical assistance notices without approval by the commissioner of the Federal police after submitting a written proposal for the notice. These mandatory technical assistance notices also must be in accordance with a valid Australian warrant.\n\nYour scenario of local police asking Atlassian to compromise your BitBucket account is simply not realistic because local police aren't allowed to issue notices. If, however, you had a search warrant issued by the courts under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the Crimes Act 1914, or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, then the notices can be issued with approval of the directors or commissioners of the relevant agencies.\n\nSo for people involved in, or suspected of major crimes, if they have a warrant issued for them then they could propose an assistance notice and possibly get access to your account if it was technically feasible without introducing backdoors (which the act specifically bans).",

You won't know it happened, Atlassian won't know it happened and now your platform is compromised and your not even the target. They don't even need a specific warrant for this.

            "body":"> What killed it more than anything else was launching in the West months after Sony had announced the much more impressive sounding PS2 (DVD games when DVDs were the new thing, selling PS2 clusters to use as supercomputers, 5x the polygon count, etc) with a massive and successful marketing campaign.\n\nThis was the major factor, but it doesn't make as cool a story as \"Piracy killed the Dreamcast\".  Piracy was just as rampant on the PS1 and PC at the time, as were emulators on the PC of current gen systems.  Those markets did just fine.  The problem was when the hardware sales fell short, 3rd party developers looked at the PS2 and shrugged the Dreamcast off.  They were already angry with Sega over the Saturn debacle (EA refused to even support the Dreamcast before launch, and sports games were Sega's bread and butter), and they could see the writing on the wall.  On top of that, Sega was panicking over bad sales and heavily discounted the system hoping for more sales, which just increased the losses they were suffering.  On the gamer side, many Sega fans jumped ship when the Saturn was killed 3 years into its launch, and many had already jumped ship to Sony.  On top of that, once the PS2 was launched the Dreamcast didn't stand a chance, the PS2 was way more powerful and could double as a DVD player, something most people didn't have yet.\n\nG4 did a documentary about it that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3rw-9Q0lJ0), and even better the Gaming Historian did a video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdBVHSrdzg).  They both address these issues and make it clear piracy wasn't what killed it but the PS2 and Sega realizing they couldn't keep up in the hardware market anymore.",

Someone *will* figure out your crypto system if it's protecting something important, and they can analyze everything offline and from the future and you can't hope to stay secret. The *design* of the crypto system can't depend on obscurity, but of course you hope the secret key stays obscure.\n",

Their plan involved selling 5 million units in the launch period and they only sold 2.91.  If piracy killed it, you'd expect to see high hardware sales but low software sales. Instead you saw the opposite, the hardware didn't sell nearly as well as they needed it to but the attach rate for software was above average. \n\nWhat killed it more than anything else was launching in the West months after Sony had announced the much more impressive sounding PS2 (DVD games when DVDs were the new thing, selling PS2 clusters to use as supercomputers, 5x the polygon count, etc) with a massive and successful marketing campaign.

Or maybe it's the designer dude who chose the logotype font?\n\nAnd how does this relate to typography? There are websites that use 20 trackers, but have good typography, and there are ones that use none but are also in monospace.\n\nThe world isn't black and white. Companies aren't uniform entities. Even if your medium does some shitty things, it can still do other things right (we all like a nice book, but who do you blame for printed media contributing to deforestation?). Although, good luck explaining it to the outrage hivemind of reddit that can't even hold a discussion for more than 4 indent levels. \n\nDo people legitimately believe the use of fixed-width characters in computing was a design choice? I'm still waiting for the first person to ask *why* you shouldn't use monospace for flowing text, or what the actual use cases are. All I got so far is the usual anonymous kneejerk reaction people here tend to have when faced with opposing viewpoints. Nobody even bothered to *wonder*.

Their  products in the US are governed by US laws. They would almost certainly be violating something. The US will not allow software to collect data on it's citizens and send it to a foreign government without it's involvement. This could also pose Constitutional issues that no one is going to want to get into.\n\nAtlassian would be forced to multiple versions of their software for each country it's sold in. Many companies already do this.\n\n>The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. \n\nIt absolutely would. All Atlassian would need to do, if they haven't already, is create a subsidiary based in the US. That subsidiary would not be subject to Australian laws.\n\n\nAlso,.something to add to this discussion that you might not be aware of but in the US some software companies are already required to provide a \"backdoor\" for law enforcement. Reddiit, Google, Facebook, ATT, Verizon,  Twitter, etc. all supply federal law enforcement agencies with some API level access.  ",
