Now it has gotten easier to burn with IMGBurn supporting the format and built in boot ability in the GDI files. But at the time, it was a bit more of a pain in the ass.\n\nSega's lack of developer support early on and developers riding the hype train of the PS2 instead of developing for Sega's unit killed the Dreamcast--along with many other factors.\n\nThat said, I love my Dreamcast(s) and still play them on occasion. But piracy is not what ultimately killed the console.",

Their plan involved selling 5 million units in the launch period and they only sold 2.91.  If piracy killed it, you'd expect to see high hardware sales but low software sales. Instead you saw the opposite, the hardware didn't sell nearly as well as they needed it to but the attach rate for software was above average. \n\nWhat killed it more than anything else was launching in the West months after Sony had announced the much more impressive sounding PS2 (DVD games when DVDs were the new thing, selling PS2 clusters to use as supercomputers, 5x the polygon count, etc) with a massive and successful marketing campaign.

            "body":"> What killed it more than anything else was launching in the West months after Sony had announced the much more impressive sounding PS2 (DVD games when DVDs were the new thing, selling PS2 clusters to use as supercomputers, 5x the polygon count, etc) with a massive and successful marketing campaign.\n\nThis was the major factor, but it doesn't make as cool a story as \"Piracy killed the Dreamcast\".  Piracy was just as rampant on the PS1 and PC at the time, as were emulators on the PC of current gen systems.  Those markets did just fine.  The problem was when the hardware sales fell short, 3rd party developers looked at the PS2 and shrugged the Dreamcast off.  They were already angry with Sega over the Saturn debacle (EA refused to even support the Dreamcast before launch, and sports games were Sega's bread and butter), and they could see the writing on the wall.  On top of that, Sega was panicking over bad sales and heavily discounted the system hoping for more sales, which just increased the losses they were suffering.  On the gamer side, many Sega fans jumped ship when the Saturn was killed 3 years into its launch, and many had already jumped ship to Sony.  On top of that, once the PS2 was launched the Dreamcast didn't stand a chance, the PS2 was way more powerful and could double as a DVD player, something most people didn't have yet.\n\nG4 did a documentary about it that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3rw-9Q0lJ0), and even better the Gaming Historian did a video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdBVHSrdzg).  They both address these issues and make it clear piracy wasn't what killed it but the PS2 and Sega realizing they couldn't keep up in the hardware market anymore.",

Bad actors knowing about the thing you wish to secure inherently makes it less secure.\n\nI use obscurity when I have to.

To be honest, that's not a particularly complex security protection, and one that could easily be reversed by anyone doing the level of hardware hacking that we saw on the PlayStation consoles.\n\nHardest part would be establishing what a \"good\" image looked like, which I'm sure [this guy](https://hackaday.com/2016/07/11/cracking-the-sega-saturn-after-20-years/) could do with his techniques.\n\nThe other thing to remember too is, tools and techniques were far less mature back then. We MD5d passwords, and used WEP for our wifi. These days, we've got attacks like [Spectre and Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) which attack things at such a fundamental layer that it's scary to consider the implications.",

This happened to the worse parts of the DMCA, and aside from a few companies that can afford to do it automatically (Google, Twitch, etc...), there's not much gov't can do that they couldn't already do before.  \n2) Companies go \"welp, too much effort to keep track of the details, let's just give them all of it.\" This is mostly how the telecom companies handled things when they were asked to provide phone triangulation, text messages, etc. If gov't comes to them with a piece of paper they'll hand over whatever, they're not going to put too much effort into fighting it.

            "body":"The act requires a warrant though for mandatory assistance notices, doesn't it?\n\nNone of the assistance notices can be done by \"local police departments\" as you say, because at the minimum it must be done by _state_ police.\n\nThe voluntary assistance request must be issued, specifically, by a director of one of the Australian intelligence agencies, or \"the chief officer of an interception agency\", where an interception agency in the paper is defined as - the Australian Federal Police; or the Australian Crime Commission; or the Police Force of a State or the Northern Territory. Local police departments have no authority to ask for voluntary assistance. These voluntary assistance notices just protect the individuals and companies from civil liability if they choose to cooperate with the investigation, and are not mandatory.\n\nAs for the mandatory assistance notices, State police CANNOT give mandatory technical assistance notices without approval by the commissioner of the Federal police after submitting a written proposal for the notice. These mandatory technical assistance notices also must be in accordance with a valid Australian warrant.\n\nYour scenario of local police asking Atlassian to compromise your BitBucket account is simply not realistic because local police aren't allowed to issue notices. If, however, you had a search warrant issued by the courts under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the Crimes Act 1914, or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, then the notices can be issued with approval of the directors or commissioners of the relevant agencies.\n\nSo for people involved in, or suspected of major crimes, if they have a warrant issued for them then they could propose an assistance notice and possibly get access to your account if it was technically feasible without introducing backdoors (which the act specifically bans).",

For example they'd have to recode their encryption to accept the configured key or a secret master key.\n\nNow the DoD is pretty good with checking this stuff, and I suspect it's something that would get discussed/disclosed. The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. It may be a violation of Australian law to export it without the backdoor. If that's the case the DoD would just declare it not suitable for use and then everyone would have to ban it.",

Now if an Australian company was located outside of Australia, it would apply, likely even for non-Australians (they wouldn't be arrested, but they'd lose their job), including Australian companies doing work for non-Australian companies.\n\nHowever, when it comes to an Australian _individual_ working for a non-Australian company, I don't buy it one bit that it would apply to them.

Their  products in the US are governed by US laws. They would almost certainly be violating something. The US will not allow software to collect data on it's citizens and send it to a foreign government without it's involvement. This could also pose Constitutional issues that no one is going to want to get into.\n\nAtlassian would be forced to multiple versions of their software for each country it's sold in. Many companies already do this.\n\n>The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. \n\nIt absolutely would. All Atlassian would need to do, if they haven't already, is create a subsidiary based in the US. That subsidiary would not be subject to Australian laws.\n\n\nAlso,.something to add to this discussion that you might not be aware of but in the US some software companies are already required to provide a \"backdoor\" for law enforcement. Reddiit, Google, Facebook, ATT, Verizon,  Twitter, etc. all supply federal law enforcement agencies with some API level access.  ",

Otherwise it would be simple to work around the GDPR.\n\nIt is absolutely correct. The GDPR carves out a very large exception for *lawful* orders. To quote:\n\n>The second part of this exemption can apply if you are required by law, or court order, to disclose personal data to a third party. It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that complying with those provisions would prevent you disclosing the personal data.\n\nFrom: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/#ex3\n\nHere's an example, again from above:\n\n>An employer receives a court order to hand over the personnel file of one of its employees to an insurance company for the assessment of a claim. Normally, the employer would not be able to disclose this information because doing so would be incompatible with the original purposes for collecting the data (contravening the purpose limitation principle). However, on this occasion the employer is exempt from the purpose limitation principle\u2019s requirements because it would prevent the employer disclosing personal data that it must do by court order.",

            "body":"I would say piracy absolutely wasn't a factor in the Dreamcast's decline, and there's one thing that really points to that: Sega fell massively short of their hardware sales goal over the first year. Their plan involved selling 5 million units in the launch period and they only sold 2.91.  If piracy killed it, you'd expect to see high hardware sales but low software sales. Instead you saw the opposite, the hardware didn't sell nearly as well as they needed it to but the attach rate for software was above average. \n\nWhat killed it more than anything else was launching in the West months after Sony had announced the much more impressive sounding PS2 (DVD games when DVDs were the new thing, selling PS2 clusters to use as supercomputers, 5x the polygon count, etc) with a massive and successful marketing campaign.

To be honest, that's not a particularly complex security protection, and one that could easily be reversed by anyone doing the level of hardware hacking that we saw on the PlayStation consoles.\n\nHardest part would be establishing what a \"good\" image looked like, which I'm sure [this guy](https://hackaday.com/2016/07/11/cracking-the-sega-saturn-after-20-years/) could do with his techniques.\n\nThe other thing to remember too is, tools and techniques were far less mature back then. We MD5d passwords, and used WEP for our wifi. These days, we've got attacks like [Spectre and Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) which attack things at such a fundamental layer that it's scary to consider the implications.",

In that case the house in the middle of the forest is more secure than one in a crime ridden urban environment.\n\nHere is another example: say I have a cupcake I intend to eat and I put it in my companies break-room with my name on it. I would argue that is less secure than putting it in my desk drawer even though both are unlocked. Bad actors knowing about the thing you wish to secure inherently makes it less secure.\n\nI use obscurity when I have to. Say I'm coming home from work with my laptop and have to pick something up at the store. I never just leave it on the seat, I stash it behind my seat and throw a blanket on it.

Piracy was just as rampant on the PS1 and PC at the time, as were emulators on the PC of current gen systems.  Those markets did just fine.  The problem was when the hardware sales fell short, 3rd party developers looked at the PS2 and shrugged the Dreamcast off.  They were already angry with Sega over the Saturn debacle (EA refused to even support the Dreamcast before launch, and sports games were Sega's bread and butter), and they could see the writing on the wall.  On top of that, Sega was panicking over bad sales and heavily discounted the system hoping for more sales, which just increased the losses they were suffering.  On the gamer side, many Sega fans jumped ship when the Saturn was killed 3 years into its launch, and many had already jumped ship to Sony.  On top of that, once the PS2 was launched the Dreamcast didn't stand a chance, the PS2 was way more powerful and could double as a DVD player, something most people didn't have yet.\n\nG4 did a documentary about it that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3rw-9Q0lJ0), and even better the Gaming Historian did a video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdBVHSrdzg).  They both address these issues and make it clear piracy wasn't what killed it but the PS2 and Sega realizing they couldn't keep up in the hardware market anymore.",

Their  products in the US are governed by US laws. They would almost certainly be violating something. The US will not allow software to collect data on it's citizens and send it to a foreign government without it's involvement. This could also pose Constitutional issues that no one is going to want to get into.\n\nAtlassian would be forced to multiple versions of their software for each country it's sold in. Many companies already do this.\n\n>The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. \n\nIt absolutely would. All Atlassian would need to do, if they haven't already, is create a subsidiary based in the US. That subsidiary would not be subject to Australian laws.\n\n\nAlso,.something to add to this discussion that you might not be aware of but in the US some software companies are already required to provide a \"backdoor\" for law enforcement. Reddiit, Google, Facebook, ATT, Verizon,  Twitter, etc. all supply federal law enforcement agencies with some API level access.  ",
