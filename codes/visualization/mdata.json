Piracy was just as rampant on the PS1 and PC at the time, as were emulators on the PC of current gen systems.  Those markets did just fine.  The problem was when the hardware sales fell short, 3rd party developers looked at the PS2 and shrugged the Dreamcast off.  They were already angry with Sega over the Saturn debacle (EA refused to even support the Dreamcast before launch, and sports games were Sega's bread and butter), and they could see the writing on the wall.  On top of that, Sega was panicking over bad sales and heavily discounted the system hoping for more sales, which just increased the losses they were suffering.  On the gamer side, many Sega fans jumped ship when the Saturn was killed 3 years into its launch, and many had already jumped ship to Sony.  On top of that, once the PS2 was launched the Dreamcast didn't stand a chance, the PS2 was way more powerful and could double as a DVD player, something most people didn't have yet.\n\nG4 did a documentary about it that you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3rw-9Q0lJ0), and even better the Gaming Historian did a video on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdBVHSrdzg).  They both address these issues and make it clear piracy wasn't what killed it but the PS2 and Sega realizing they couldn't keep up in the hardware market anymore.",

            "body":"Your house example has a flaw in that we know there are people who try to break in houses. If those people intended to break the door down it doesn't matter if it was locked. In that case the house in the middle of the forest is more secure than one in a crime ridden urban environment.\n\nHere is another example: say I have a cupcake I intend to eat and I put it in my companies break-room with my name on it. I would argue that is less secure than putting it in my desk drawer even though both are unlocked. Bad actors knowing about the thing you wish to secure inherently makes it less secure.\n\nI use obscurity when I have to. Say I'm coming home from work with my laptop and have to pick something up at the store. I never just leave it on the seat, I stash it behind my seat and throw a blanket on it. Now I do lock my car but I feel this better secures the laptop from someone who would break my window and steal it. ",

Their  products in the US are governed by US laws. They would almost certainly be violating something. The US will not allow software to collect data on it's citizens and send it to a foreign government without it's involvement. This could also pose Constitutional issues that no one is going to want to get into.\n\nAtlassian would be forced to multiple versions of their software for each country it's sold in. Many companies already do this.\n\n>The question becomes is it legal for Altatssan to sell the DoD a version of their software that doesn't have the backdoor. \n\nIt absolutely would. All Atlassian would need to do, if they haven't already, is create a subsidiary based in the US. That subsidiary would not be subject to Australian laws.\n\n\nAlso,.something to add to this discussion that you might not be aware of but in the US some software companies are already required to provide a \"backdoor\" for law enforcement. Reddiit, Google, Facebook, ATT, Verizon,  Twitter, etc. all supply federal law enforcement agencies with some API level access.  ",

This basically means that if the scenario above is valid, atlassian may be forced to stop delivering their software to eu countries as risk mitigation as soon as they know that they built in a backdoor. Because of this, they may be forced to introduce better code reviews to detect if one developer was forced to introduce such a feature.\n\n> Their government would protect them,\n\nThey sold to europe and as such they are obliged to honor european laws. How can au's government protect a company from fines?\n\n---\n\nOr is the real problem here a different scenario?\n\nWhat if:\n\n* nobody detects the backdoor.\n* would they be able to deliver this upgrade to a specific installation?
